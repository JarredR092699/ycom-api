Hunger is not a scarcity problem; it's a logistics problem.\r\n\r\nFor the first time ever, we can effectively donate prepared and highly perishable food to those who need it when we need it most. Copia is a for-profit company that has built technology allowing businesses (e.g., food management companies like Compass Group, corporate cafeterias, universities, hospitals, grocers, caterers, etc.) to easily request pickups of their surplus food, have it matched, and safely delivered to non-profits in need. With Copia, partnering businesses can seamlessly access significant tax savings, dramatically reduce food waste through data and analytics on surplus, and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, all while feeding their community.\r\n\r\nWe have diverted over 7M pounds of edible food from landfills and provided businesses and nonprofits with over $23M in savings. We will feed over 7M people with incredible food that would have otherwise been wasted!",

It’s why in 2014, Dr. Sara Naseri and Søren Therkelsen started Qvin to research, develop, and patent a product that powers an underserved and understudied population—women.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of the decisions our doctors make are influenced by blood test results.  Every month, 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate. However, the blood our bodies naturally deliver every month has never been explored as a testing source. And yet, menstrual blood has been left unexplored.\r\n\r\nQvin is the first and only healthcare service to use period blood as a non-invasive blood test. We exist to give women an easy, insightful way to monitor existing health issues, proactively screen for others, and go into doctor visits more informed and confident of their own health.\r\n\r\nOur health technology platform helps women manage their health better through a non-invasive blood collection device named the Q-Pad™.\r\n\r\nAll of us at Qvin want to move the study of women forward.

We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

Since the data we obtain derives from auction records and repeat sales, our model relies on a set of features about each result. These features include include the artist’s name, medium, date of creation, origin of location and size of work. After identifying groups of work that are similar to each other, we calculate the expected ROI and estimated volatility based on the distribution of gains. Using historical auction results to simulate the performance of our funds, we leverage Monte Carlo analysis to determine annualized returns and sharpe ratios.

Our AI platform has enabled us to develop a purpose-built therapy for ARDS to reduce its $20 billion cost on society (just in the USA). \r\n \r\nGEn1E has built a rich pipeline of 21+ novel and selective immunomodulators and has plans to accelerate 2 additional devastating diseases (beyond their lead indication) to IND in the next 12 months. Our AI platform enables tremendous pace and capital efficiency as demonstrated by our progress in ~2 years with seed capital—a stark contrast to the typical spend of $100M+ and 7+ years exhibited in the pharmaceuticals / biotech industry.\r\n \r\nWith ~90% of rare diseases having no therapeutic treatment at all, GEn1E is taking a giant swing that will hopefully bring life-saving therapies to the lives of patients in need.\r\n \r\nThe team at GEn1E has decades of experience in drug development and machine learning.

In the services section, we have more than 17 services, all the healthcare, beauty and entertainment services.

This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.\r\n\r\nWhy now?\r\nThe biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.\r\n\r\nWhere are we and where are we going?\r\nWe have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.\r\n\r\nThank you! ",

Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. \r\n\r\nHowever, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.\r\n\r\nWe’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund.

In 2022, the Department of Labor estimates there is a global talent shortage of 40 million workers, and that number is expected to grow to over 85 million by 2030. In order for companies to win the war for talent, they need to provide a best-in-class candidate experience to recruit top talent, and our product aims at doing just that!\r\n\r\nOur founders Lydia Han (CEO) and Chris Triolo (CTO) both founded ModernLoop in December of 2020 after they saw the challenges recruiting teams had when it came to coordinating hundreds of interviews across various teams, all while making sure both hiring managers and candidates had the best experience possible. After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

The founders Patricia Bubner, PhD, Samet Yildirim, MSc, MBS and Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, PhD have over 30 years of combined experience in business and product development, bioprocessing and biopharma. After only 4 months of development time, Orbillion has four different flavorful meats growing in the lab: wagyu beef, elk, sheep and American bison. Using their proprietary platform technology, Orbillion is rapidly decreasing the cost of cultivated meat. Major investors in our pre seed round were Y Combinator, New Protein Fund, Joyance Partners and Venture Souq. https://www.orbillion.com/",

Just 4 weeks after going live with our first customer, we purchased $1.3M in loans across 6 customers. The founding team brings 30+ years of startup experience: Vladimir previously worked as an operator at Facebook, Eventbrite, and Niantic; Asa Schachar was an engineer at Microsoft and managed teams of engineers at Optimizely; Molly Hogan led new and international product initiatives at Amazon for over 7 years.

To date our platform has successfully been used to test 12 drugs, and vaccines against 8 different diseases.

The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.",

LunaJoy utilizes technology and data science to provide intelligent touchpoints that decrease costs and accelerate outcomes. We are increasing our in-network footprint to provide truly accessible care for all. \r\n\r\nWomen are twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties. Rates are even higher for women of color and LGBTQ+ folks. Women are 3x more likely to experience sexual, physical, emotional trauma which is a predictor for mental illness. This is just the tip of the iceberg! Physiologically, women experience hormonal fluctuations which make them more vulnerable to mental health issues during times of transition such as puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. We also face unique stressors as the emotional bedrock of our homes, supporting young families, elderly adults, and a huge part of the workforce. The downstream effects of this gap in care are far-reaching into our ecosystems. Currently, mental health care is expensive, inconvenient, and generalist where a specialized approach is needed.

Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. \r\n\r\nThe product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:\r\n\r\n(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.\r\n\r\n(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.\r\n\r\n(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that’s 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M.",

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.\r\n\r\nIndia is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. \r\n\r\nGold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.\r\n\r\nUsing automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. \r\n\r\nWith 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.\r\n\r\nGullak’s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy.\r\n",

For example, they talk to our AI copilot, as if they’re talking to a human matchmaker, in plain English they specify their preferences. They can be as specific as possible, e.g. someone with an entrepreneurial spirit, who appreciates fine art, enjoys discussing politics and comes from a big family. Our technology then finds their ideal partner. \r\nSo far, we've helped create over 10,000 couples and in the future our AI copilot will offer these couples support for relationship success, like improving their communication, financial planning, couple’s legal assistance, and navigating life events.",

We demonstrated that our drug is safe, selectively blocks nerves that transmit pain, and provides pain relief that lasts four times as long. \r\nInsurance currently pays $770 per six-monthly treatment for knee osteoarthritis. With 5 million patients in the US, this represents a $7.7 Bn market opportunity.\r\nThis platform biotherapeutic can also be used to treat other joints affects by osteoarthritis such as the hip and ankle, where the same problems exist in treatment care.

Dendritic cells sit at the helm of the immune system, directing and dictating immune responses. Data has shown dendritic cells are often dysfunctional in cancer patients, and that this dysfunction is a bottleneck for other therapies. \r\n\r\nGuardian Bio’s approach is focused on creating a dendritic cell-based product which drives anti-tumor activity through activating the killers of the immune system AND training them against multiple cancer targets. We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into specific therapeutic dendritic cells specially trained against that patient’s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body. \r\n\r\nOur therapeutic dendritic cells revitalize the killers of the immune system and give them the kickstart they need to fight - and win - against cancer.",

By teaching our body’s immune system to recognize and kill the drivers of cancer, we can eliminate the majority of all cancer deaths.\r\n\r\nA little more detail to understand our scientific approach: A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn’t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually – preventing the majority of cancer deaths. \r\n\r\nOur team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden’s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials). Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jen Herbach, who has more than a decade of biotech industry experience including with Amunix (the second largest oncology pre-clinical stage acquisition).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in learning more about our approach to treat and prevent cancer, please reach out to us at contact@adventrispharma.com",

Through thoughtful marketing and partnerships with care organizations like rehab centers, we connect SLPs with individuals who need their expertise. Our AI-enabled back office streamlines insurance processing, scheduling, and documentation, reducing non-therapy overhead. We're now live in 10 states with over 35 dedicated therapists and are in-network with leading insurance providers, making it easier for clients to receive the support they need.",

    "long_description": "We make it easy for AI agents to buy anything on the internet. For example, if a user asked an AI agent to buy a book on an e-commerce site, we handle the purchase via our Purchasing API. \r\n\r\nAI agents are poised to elevate the way we shop, but they aren’t reliably making purchases today. We’re changing that by bringing uniformity to non-uniform checkout flows across the internet.\r\n\r\nOur expertise is at the intersection of payments and e-commerce. Angelica was a staff engineer at Stripe, driving API evolution, design, and governance across payments products. Scott was a senior investor at Sycamore Partners, investing in and partnering with leading consumer companies. \r\n\r\nOur solution will enable AI agents to make payments of every kind, including e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, eBay), consumer services (e.g., Uber, DoorDash), and B2B (e.g., supplier payment). In the US e-commerce market alone, there are 10B transactions every year, representing a significant opportunity for us. We have already onboarded multiple AI agent customers who have thousands of monthly users and have begun integrating them to power their e-commerce purchases. ",
