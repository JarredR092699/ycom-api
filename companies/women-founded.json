We still operate in a world built by men, for men. It’s why in 2014, Dr. Sara Naseri and Søren Therkelsen started Qvin to research, develop, and patent a product that powers an underserved and understudied population—women.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of the decisions our doctors make are influenced by blood test results.  Every month, 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate. However, the blood our bodies naturally deliver every month has never been explored as a testing source. And yet, menstrual blood has been left unexplored.\r\n\r\nQvin is the first and only healthcare service to use period blood as a non-invasive blood test. We exist to give women an easy, insightful way to monitor existing health issues, proactively screen for others, and go into doctor visits more informed and confident of their own health.\r\n\r\nOur health technology platform helps women manage their health better through a non-invasive blood collection device named the Q-Pad™.\r\n\r\nAll of us at Qvin want to move the study of women forward. We want to close the gender data gap. And we stand for every person who identifies with women, however they define it.",

    "long_description": "We’re on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry.\r\n\r\nWhen we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

HNWI’s can now securely and confidently diversify their portfolios into alternative assets focusing on the luxury market.\r\n\r\nArthena has designed and built a statistically rigorous model that estimates the value of artwork over time. Since the data we obtain derives from auction records and repeat sales, our model relies on a set of features about each result. These features include include the artist’s name, medium, date of creation, origin of location and size of work. After identifying groups of work that are similar to each other, we calculate the expected ROI and estimated volatility based on the distribution of gains. Using historical auction results to simulate the performance of our funds, we leverage Monte Carlo analysis to determine annualized returns and sharpe ratios. Based on this analysis, Arthena can validate the financial viability of our product and establish statistically rigorous bounds for these estimates.",

Our platform technology, AesculaGel offers adaptive response to a wide range of stimuli and can be tailor-made for biocompatibility, material strength, and a range of other attributes. \r\n\r\nFounded by one of MIT's 35 under 35 Innovators, AesculaTech is the shared vision of scientists, engineers, and medical experts. Our cornerstone product, Humidifeye, is an ophthalmic platform to treat dry eye disease. Dry eye affects more than 25 million Americans and the global treatment market is projected higher than $6 Billion within the next decade. Our thermally responsive, form-fitting materials are suitable for sustained yet reversible occlusion across a range of treatment times. In contrast to existing technologies, our product will not extrude, or cause discomfort as it adapts to patients. Though Humidifeye is not yet FDA approved, expect to hear about it soon!\r\n\r\nIn coordination with partners across several sectors, we have a variety of groundbreaking technologies in the works that live up to our vision. This work has already been recognized. AesculaTech was named a Rosenman Innovator, received a National Science Foundation I-Corps grant, was a finalist in the 2019 Octane High Tech Awards, and is a graduate of both the Y Combinator and TMCx accelerator programs. In short, Y-Combinator was only the beginning. \r\n\r\n",

But we did have an idea: what if we could build financial software that powers our democracy? \r\n\r\nRunning for office is hard work – the outdated software that runs campaigns makes it even harder. We believe it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why we built Numero, a modern financial platform that Democratic elected officials and candidates at all levels of public office can use to manage the $24 billion in contributions to political campaigns.\r\n\r\nOur core product is a CRM software suite that includes a native mobile app, payment processor, referral tracker, and event management system to keep donations, pledges, and donors organized in a single place. We also just launched Electables – a grassroots fundraising platform enabling campaigns to reward their donors with unique digital collectibles. Every product we build saves our clients hours of work every week either via automation, smarter data processing, or even simply better UX. We also always build an embedded fintech component (e.g. we process payments on behalf of our clients) so that we earn revenue with every dollar our clients raise.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staff, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.\r\n\r\nSince our founding, we've served over 1,000 clients at every level from city council to US Senate (who have collectively managed $2B+ of contributions on our platform). And there’s much more room for us to grow. The US has more than 500,000 elected officials, and many more candidates run for office at all levels of government. ",

Our AI platform has enabled us to develop a purpose-built therapy for ARDS to reduce its $20 billion cost on society (just in the USA). \r\n \r\nGEn1E has built a rich pipeline of 21+ novel and selective immunomodulators and has plans to accelerate 2 additional devastating diseases (beyond their lead indication) to IND in the next 12 months. Our AI platform enables tremendous pace and capital efficiency as demonstrated by our progress in ~2 years with seed capital—a stark contrast to the typical spend of $100M+ and 7+ years exhibited in the pharmaceuticals / biotech industry.\r\n \r\nWith ~90% of rare diseases having no therapeutic treatment at all, GEn1E is taking a giant swing that will hopefully bring life-saving therapies to the lives of patients in need.\r\n \r\nThe team at GEn1E has decades of experience in drug development and machine learning.

In the products section, we have more than 4,000 references (among which you can find most of the brands of food, snacks, medicines, accessories and others). In the services section, we have more than 17 services, all the healthcare, beauty and entertainment services.

This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.\r\n\r\nWhy now?\r\nThe biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.\r\n\r\nWhere are we and where are we going?\r\nWe have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.\r\n\r\nThank you! ",

We also provide users with a credit card secured by their investments. \r\n\r\nWe launched with money market funds and have ~40,000 customers who’ve invested (~40% MoM growth). The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we’ve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. \r\n\r\nHere’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. \r\n\r\nHowever, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.\r\n\r\nWe’re building an AI - driven investment planning software that is designed for beginners. Users use our conversational AI to get diversified mutual fund portfolios tailored to their goals. We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of business model, we make commissions on the asset we manage, and interchange fees on the fund. We estimate we can make $12 per user per year, which is 6x our current acquisition cost of $2 per investor.",

In Nigeria, Africa's largest economy and home to 30% of all the wealth in Sub Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), 99.99% of the investing population do not have access to invest globally. Even for the 0.01%, if you wanted to buy a US stock, you’d have to call your asset manager who would then call an international broker to execute a trade.

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

Patients spend up to 10 years and thousands of rupees searching for the right treatment, yet 90% are dissatisfied with existing options. With our program, 85% patients report feeling \"in control\" of their PCOS after just 1 month and are 4-times more likely to complete treatment.\r\n\r\nThe founders, Shobhita (COO) and Shashwata (CEO) got an inside view into this massive need when the former was diagnosed with PCOS. Shashwata studied data science at Yale University, holds an MBA from Wharton, and helped grow Fortune 100 and growth-stage consumer health / product companies at McKinsey. Shobhita studied Biology & Psychology at Tufts University and has worked with leading healthcare companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline, Accenture Life Sciences & UnitedHealth.",

Our initial target market is sorority girls who can have up to 3-4 events per week that they need a new outfit/dress for. One of our core theses is that this idea couldn’t have existed at scale until now because resale apps like Depop & Poshmark paved the way for a P2P model to work after familiarizing users with the process of taking pictures of items, shipping, etc. \r\n\r\nAdvantages to our P2P model\r\n\r\n- Entrepreneur-led\r\n    - Similar to Depop, most of our growth will be spearheaded by a group of “top renters”\r\n- More variety in inventory\r\n    - Existing rental companies like Rent the Runway own all the inventory so they're limited to the brands they buy/partner with. Since we're P2P, our users can rent any item or brand that's in someone else's closet\r\n- Better margins\r\n    - we don’t touch any inventory or deal with the cleaning of any items\r\n    - Unlike Rent the Runway, we don’t handle any inventory or the cleaning of items. This means people renting out their clothing on Dressd are responsible for shipping things out & returning them in good condition\r\n\r\nHere are some of our links!\r\n\r\n[dressd website](https://dressd.com/stylist-waitlist)\r\n\r\n[dressd instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shop.dressd/)\r\n\r\n[dressd tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdMPYFRY/)\r\n\r\nread about dressd in Yahoo!

The biggest reason why 95% of new drugs fail is that they were tested in mice - but with our human platform, pharma companies will know which drugs will successfully treat patients, speeding up the process and reducing the cost. To date our platform has successfully been used to test 12 drugs, and vaccines against 8 different diseases.

The anti-pathogenic molecules from milk can be developed into therapeutics geared towards all-age diseases. Our first indication is bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial dysbiosis related inflammation that results in recurrent infections, disruption of homeostasis and long-term clinical complications in women of reproductive age, including but not limited to preterm births, fertility issues and increased rates of STDs. Our next inflection point is the evaluation of rapidly acting and selective candidate peptides in pre-clinical host impact and early safety studies, which can aid clinical and portfolio development towards topical applications.",

LunaJoy utilizes technology and data science to provide intelligent touchpoints that decrease costs and accelerate outcomes. We are increasing our in-network footprint to provide truly accessible care for all. \r\n\r\nWomen are twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties. Rates are even higher for women of color and LGBTQ+ folks. Women are 3x more likely to experience sexual, physical, emotional trauma which is a predictor for mental illness. This is just the tip of the iceberg! Physiologically, women experience hormonal fluctuations which make them more vulnerable to mental health issues during times of transition such as puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. We also face unique stressors as the emotional bedrock of our homes, supporting young families, elderly adults, and a huge part of the workforce. The downstream effects of this gap in care are far-reaching into our ecosystems. Currently, mental health care is expensive, inconvenient, and generalist where a specialized approach is needed. When we attend to women’s mental health, we all shine brighter!",

We have already identified small molecules that reduce the toxic mutated protein, suppress mutant protein-induced toxicities in human disease neurons and get into the brain.

    "long_description": "ALT TEX is a Toronto-based biomaterials startup that has developed the world’s first biodegradable and carbon neutral fabric, engineered from the world’s largest landfill contributor - food waste. Polyester alone makes up 60% of the $2.5 trillion fashion industry and is the biggest blocker preventing brands from meeting sustainability mandates. The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. \r\n\r\nThe product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:\r\n\r\n(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.\r\n\r\n(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.\r\n\r\n(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that’s 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M.",

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.\r\n\r\nIndia is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. \r\n\r\nGold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.\r\n\r\nUsing automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. \r\n\r\nWith 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.\r\n\r\nGullak’s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy.\r\n",

For example, they talk to our AI copilot, as if they’re talking to a human matchmaker, in plain English they specify their preferences. They can be as specific as possible, e.g. someone with an entrepreneurial spirit, who appreciates fine art, enjoys discussing politics and comes from a big family. Our technology then finds their ideal partner. \r\nSo far, we've helped create over 10,000 couples and in the future our AI copilot will offer these couples support for relationship success, like improving their communication, financial planning, couple’s legal assistance, and navigating life events.",

We demonstrated that our drug is safe, selectively blocks nerves that transmit pain, and provides pain relief that lasts four times as long. \r\nInsurance currently pays $770 per six-monthly treatment for knee osteoarthritis. With 5 million patients in the US, this represents a $7.7 Bn market opportunity.\r\nThis platform biotherapeutic can also be used to treat other joints affects by osteoarthritis such as the hip and ankle, where the same problems exist in treatment care.

We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into specific therapeutic dendritic cells specially trained against that patient’s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body. \r\n\r\nOur therapeutic dendritic cells revitalize the killers of the immune system and give them the kickstart they need to fight - and win - against cancer.",

Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn’t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually – preventing the majority of cancer deaths. \r\n\r\nOur team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden’s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple cancer vaccine clinical trials). Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jen Herbach, who has more than a decade of biotech industry experience including with Amunix (the second largest oncology pre-clinical stage acquisition).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in learning more about our approach to treat and prevent cancer, please reach out to us at contact@adventrispharma.com",

However, with the increase of renewable energy as a mix of the electricity supply, comes an intermittent and more volatile balance between supply and demand.  With the mass adoption of EVs, the increasingly urgent demand for air conditioning and electrification of heat, overall electricity demand is outpacing the transformation of the grid. \r\n\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is helping to solve the problem of supply and demand with energy flexibility at scale, starting with the 1.6 million commercial buildings in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur SaaS platform enables large commercial buildings to leverage their distributed energy resources (smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery) to reduce strain on the grid at hours of peak demand and lower their energy costs.\r\n\r\nWe connect to a range of APIs from smart thermostats, HVAC systems, solar, battery etc. to automate measures of energy consumption reduction and opt-in to national grid demand response events where customers can earn money for energy reduction. By shifting 10% of peak time consumption, we save companies 15% on their electricity bill and reduce their CO2 emissions by 7%.\r\n\r\nElyos Energy is leveraging energy flexibility, at mass-market scale to enable electrification of the energy system.",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

Today, construction companies pay for 8-17 different tools - that we eliminate the need for. \r\n\r\nWe reduce \r\n\r\n- Manual work by 60%\r\n- Cut software costs by $10,000 monthly\r\n- Complete projects 3x faster. \r\n\r\nWhy Now?\r\nWe're witnessing a perfect storm of factors: decades of stagnation in traditional ERP systems, a multi-billion-dollar industry built on misaligned incentives, and the transformative potential of AI. This confluence creates a rare cyclical opportunity for market upheaval. The last major shift in this space occurred in the 1990s with the advent of digital systems, and now, 30 years later, we're on the cusp of another seismic change. Customers are crying out for innovation and as AI reshapes the landscape, early customer signals indicate an eagerness for smarter, more efficient systems. It's a unique window of opportunity that opens perhaps once in a multi-decade chance to redefine an entire industry's operational backbone.\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\nKS, a BITS Pilani grad and successful startup co-founder, and Ayantika, an IIT alumni and tech expert, bring extensive coding and product development expertise together bringing about over a decade of technical expertise.
