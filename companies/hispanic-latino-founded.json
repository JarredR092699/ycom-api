To prevent rework and increased building maintenance costs, Resolve fixes the broken system of screen-sharing 3D models and 2D floorplans with the operations teams that inherit the building and, instead, gives them easy access to their 3D building models before concrete is poured.",

We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.\r\n\r\nWe saw a problem we wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nToday, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.\r\n\r\nOur ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",

A pet ecosystem that combines On and offline platform where pet owners will find a solution for all their needs, including products & services. \r\nCurrently, to meet the needs of their pets, people must go to different places and platforms. To find products, they go to one place; for services, they go to several others; and for healthcare, a few more. In Colombia, in average, a person must visit or consult more than seven places per year to meet the needs of their pets.\r\n\r\nWe built a digital platform where users don’t have to go anywhere else to meet said needs. With two main sections; products and services. In the products section, we have more than 4,000 references (among which you can find most of the brands of food, snacks, medicines, accessories and others). In the services section, we have more than 17 services, all the healthcare, beauty and entertainment services. All of the above delivered straight to your home and with the flexibility of choosing the date and time on and at which you wish to receive the order, including same-day deliveries for the main cities and accepting all payment methods, both online and cash on delivery.",

In order for companies to win the war for talent, they need to provide a best-in-class candidate experience to recruit top talent, and our product aims at doing just that!\r\n\r\nOur founders Lydia Han (CEO) and Chris Triolo (CTO) both founded ModernLoop in December of 2020 after they saw the challenges recruiting teams had when it came to coordinating hundreds of interviews across various teams, all while making sure both hiring managers and candidates had the best experience possible. After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

Most of this treatment is funded by governments, and goes to programs that are frequently predatory, and focus more on profit than people.\r\n\r\nWe have created an effective, accessible, and affordable solution: Recover. We offer a proven approach using medication and counseling, that can improve outcomes for over 70% of patients. It reduces overdoses by 80%, death by 50%, and has years of research and application showing it works. \r\n\r\nDespite how effective this medication can be, most rehabs do not have medical professionals on staff. Not only does our program work better and bring medicine to addiction care, it also costs just 10% of traditional programs.\r\n\r\nNick founded Recover after seeing his family and friends struggle with addiction. He was raised by a drug addict, has an alcoholic brother, and lost an uncle to heroin. He saw how hard it is for people to get the treatment they need, and how ineffective existing options are.

    "long_description": "At Cero, we solve specific coordination tasks between hospitals and patients, such as appointment confirmations and last minute cancellations, by automatically communicating with patients over WhatsApp. For example, a patient can confirm and reschedule their appointment without needing to call anyone.\r\n\r\nAlmost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).\r\n \r\nWe bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. As of August 2021 we have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.\r\n\r\nWe are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).\r\n\r\nIn a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology. The three together have designed and run a solution that as of 2021 is coordinating over 600,000 patients per month in their home country, Chile.",

For each property we set up the investment trust, find qualified co-owners, and handle the entire real estate purchase transaction. Costs are split amongst the co-owners, and we take care of the furnishing and ongoing property management.\r\n\r\nWe accomplish this by creating an investment trust for each property and dividing it into individual, purchasable shares that represent ownership in the property. We furnish each home and find and vet the co-owners. Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise. Unlike a timeshare, Ancana owners own a real asset (the property) versus a block of time. If you decide you want to sell your share, you are free to do so at any time, either through us or on the open market, and capture any appreciation the property has accrued.",

Our first deal for $82.5K / month starts next week.\r\n\r\nEach year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from state and federal prisons. Another nine million are released from local jails. Yet, a year after reentry, 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed.

We launched Tuva and joined the W22 batch of Y Combinator to solve this problem for the entire industry.  Since January 1st, we signed our first customer (paying $10k per month) and completed the first major release of the Tuva Project.  At Tuva, our goal is to (1) become the open standard for healthcare data transformation and (2) build the data network for multi-site benchmarking, research, and machine learning on top of this open standard.",

Traditionally, healthcare providers have done this manually, with limited automation around one-way reminders. This leads to limited engagement with payers and subpar collection results.\r\n\r\nArgovox changes this by making new levels of payer engagement possible at scale.

No fine-tuning. No modifying the model.\r\nThat means less time prompt engineering to get the same quality results.\r\n\r\nRecently, we showed that our method makes GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude-Haiku perform at the same level as GPT-4o without (of course GPT-4o gets better with us as well). Read more here: https://www.boundaryml.com/blog/sota-function-calling\r\n\r\nBoundary is composed of three main components:\r\n\r\n1. BAML - a simple programming language to get structured outputs from LLMs.\r\n2. BAML Playground - The first-ever VSCode playground for LLMs, that helps developers test and iterate on their AI functions.\r\n3. Boundary Studio - An analytics dashboard to trace, label, and measure performance.\r\n\r\nBoundary's mission is to make AI app development seamless, and supports the entire development journey, from initial prompt iteration to measuring performance post-deployment.",

We achieve this accuracy by constraining our genAI-based simulations to obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies.\r\n\r\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate gen-AI based simulation of multiple molecules interacting.

And as a result, we spent much of our time and hundreds of thousands of dollars creating robust internal tooling to ensure we were doing things the right way.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the pain of hunting through regulatory codes, confusion of form filling, surprise of regulatory deadlines, monotony of PDF data extraction, anxiety of brittle excel spreadsheets, the frustration of buried email threads with advisors, and the missed phone calls with borrowers to chase payments … to name a few … we knew that this experience needed to be improved. \r\n\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.\r\n\r\nFinsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe operational cost of originating and servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business – we are changing that.",

Conversely, over the past decade, currency depreciation across the region has become unsustainable.
