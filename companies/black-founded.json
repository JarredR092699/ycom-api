In doing so, we're building game-changing products manufactured at scale, while perfecting the safety, reliability, and capabilities of our autonomy engine and electric propulsion systems. \r\n\r\nWe design, develop and manufacture an ecosystem of technologies including proprietary flight control software, avionics, high power density motors, motor controllers, batteries, and custom carbon-fiber composite airframes.\r\n\r\nToday, we supply autonomous electric aircraft for cargo transport and crop protection to real-world customers across four separate continents and have secured industry-first regulatory approvals from the FAA. \r\n\r\nOur cargo aircraft enables remote connectivity, enhances express delivery networks, and ensures fast and reliable shipping of critical supplies to areas in need. Our crop protection aircraft offers agricultural services providers and farmers an autonomous tool to make aerial application safer, more precise, and less harmful to surrounding environments. Both vehicles are highly economical to operate, easy to deploy, and significantly reduce C02 emissions in their respective industries.  \r\n\r\nWhat you work on at Pyka makes people’s lives better now and brings the future of electric aviation one step closer each day. \r\n",

Merchants can accept payments in crypto or in fiat.\r\nPayments made in Crypto can easily convert into fiat due to the built in fast reconciliation and is made available for spending immediately.\r\nCurrently the vast majority merchants receive payments in crypto because of two issues (1) Paypal, Venmo, CashApp or Square to not exist in Africa and (2) the local currency fluctuates more than bitcoin due to inflation. But in order for merchants to receive money in crypto and exchange it into fiat they resort to crypto exchange apps and crypto addresses to receive payments which is a very complicated and expensive process.

    "long_description": "In the global fight against breast cancer, Digistain stands at the forefront, offering a beacon of hope to millions. Our journey began at Imperial College London, where ground-breaking research gave birth to a technology poised to revolutionize breast cancer diagnostics.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge: Every year, breast cancer affects 2.3 million individuals globally. Post-surgery, 60% of patients are advised to undergo genomic testing, an expensive and time-consuming process monopolized by a single lab in the U.S., costing around $4,000 and taking nearly two months. Consequently, only 5% undergo this vital testing. The rest, unable to access this crucial diagnostic step, often resort to chemotherapy—a treatment that, in one in four cases, is more harmful than the cancer itself.\r\n\r\nOur Solution: Digistain addresses this critical gap. Our technology transforms the current diagnostic process by enabling hospitals to analyze patient samples in-house using existing equipment, supplemented with our innovative technology. This approach offers near-instantaneous decision-making data, a stark contrast to the existing month-long waits. Central to our technology is a proprietary algorithm that identifies a unique spectral fingerprint of the tumour in the infrared spectrum, providing a personalized risk score. This score guides oncologists in selecting the most effective, individualized treatment plans, potentially reducing unnecessary chemotherapy and its harmful side effects.\r\n\r\nImpact and Potential: Our solution not only challenges the status quo in technology but also in accessibility. In a landmark government-commissioned study, Digistain demonstrated clinical evidence on par with the market leader, but at a fraction of the cost and time. Already making waves in clinical practice globally, with insurance reimbursement at leading cancer centers, our technology represents a paradigm shift in cancer care.\r\n\r\nRecognized by the Institute of Physics, the Royal Society, and Imperial College for our innovative contributions, and supported by entities like the NHS, Y Combinator, and the European Investment Bank, Digistain is more than a company—it’s a movement towards equitable, effective cancer treatment. With the potential to democratize access to life-saving diagnostics, Digistain is not just envisioning a better future for cancer patients; we are actively creating it.\r\n ",

If you're a Californian nomad living in Mexico City, you can use Blaze to pay rent to your Mexican landlord. And if you're an expat living in Colombia, you can use Blaze to pay your Spanish teacher for classes. \r\n\r\nIn addition to P2P, we're also enabling a network of travel-related businesses to accept payments on Blaze and reach our customer base of global citizens. For example, a Travel Concierge business in Jamaica can accept payments on Blaze from her US customers coming to visit for the summer.\r\n\r\nDuring a 6 month stint traveling around Asia, Faiyam experienced first hand the frustrations of paying people from different countries. Luc was experiencing the same in his travels around Latin America. Fees were exorbitant, apps that worked for one person didn't work for the other, and the user experiences were cumbersome.\r\n\r\nEnter Blaze. \r\n\r\nCross-border P2P payments is projected to be a $9T market by 2030. Our long term vision is that you should be able to drop in to any country on the planet and pay anyone you meet simply, quickly, and affordably. It's easy to send an sms to anyone anywhere in the world without thinking about where they're from. We want to do the same with payments. \r\n\r\nThe advent of consumer friendly blockchain tech, especially stablecoins, presents a unique opportunity to do this. The legacy financial system stitches together otherwise siloed country-specific systems to handle cross-border payments. Blockchain has no such notion of a border in the first place. As such the present moment is a unique, generational opportunity to rewrite the rules of global finance. \r\n\r\nFaiyam studied Math at Duke and engineering at Cornell before building a $1M ARR company with Luc. Luc’s a former technical lead at Spotify and Artsy, who studied Engineering at NYU and has cofounded 2 VC-backed startups, one that hit #1 in app store and got him sued by Drake. Igor led design at Bitpanda, Austria’s first unicorn.\r\n",

For many of these owners, selling to their employees is a socially-minded yet financially pragmatic solution.\r\n\r\nBy selling ownership of their business to an ESOP, owners get a fair price, tax benefits, and the satisfaction of knowing their employees and legacy will be taken care of — things not guaranteed with traditional buyers like private equity. In turn, employees retain their jobs and get shares in the business that can help them create life changing wealth by the time they retire — imagine an office secretary retiring as a millionaire. \r\n\r\nThousands of businesses across America like Bob's Red Mill, Harpoon Brewery, and Recology already have an ESOP, benefiting over 14 million workers and creating 2.1 trillion in employee wealth. We're excited about the opportunity to massively grow these numbers by making it simple for every business to become employee owned. \r\n",
