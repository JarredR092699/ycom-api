We're fully open source, and provide a unique integrated development & observability experience for those building anything in the AI space. This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",

Enterprises choose our AI sales platform because we automatically find prospects, research them, and hyper-personalize outbound messages that get 80% open rates, which is 4x the industry standard (our AISDR / AIBDR platform 2-4x's the reply rates you are currently getting).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur AI sales platform consists of 3 core components:\r\n\r\nFirst, Fiber AI manages domain and email health to achieve 80% open rates. We configure cold email infrastructure to maximize email deliverability. Our product will automatically configure your DNS records, warm up your emails (email warmup), orchestrate emails to send optimally across all your accounts, run multi-layer email bounce detection (email waterfall), and modify each outgoing cold outreach to ensure your cold outbound sales emails don't trigger spam filters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, we automate sales lead generation with dynamic audiences (AI powered sales assistant, AI based SDR). We have B2B company data on 60 million B2B companies and 800 million B2B contacts, sourced from dozens of data providers (i.e. think sources like BuiltWith, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, SemRush, Apollo data, and more). This allows you to precisely segment your audience by the companies you care about and exclude everyone else. Our audiences are dynamic (i.e., account based marketing, account based sales, ABM), meaning we continuously look for prospects matching your targeting criteria and add them to your audience to run our automated outbound sales sequences. This automates manual workflows you might be running on platforms like Clay or Persana. You can also create an audience once based on intent signals (i.e., GTM or go-to-market signals, sales intelligence) and put your outreach on autopilot.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, our AI sales copilot (AI sales agent, AI based BDR) enables AI powered hyper-personalized emails that boost response rates. The biggest debate in sales is choosing between relevancy and personalization—now you don’t have to. We search far and wide to find the “golden nugget” of information to connect with your prospect, and then use GPT-4 to write hyper personalized email sequences that dramatically increase reply rates and book meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of these core differences, we stand out from competitors. Products like apollo io have poor email deliverability rates that ruin email health long-term. Existing email outbound tools like amplemarket, reply io, marketo, and outreach io don't scale well and restrict you to small volumes of outbound emails. AI features to autopilot campaigns are missing in products like smartlead ai, instantly, unify gtm, penguin ai, and warmly ai. Currently, our philosophy is to allow AI to 100-1000x your team's output while maintaining extremely high email quality. AI sales copilots like reggie ai, aisdr, artisan ai / artisan sdr / artisan bdr, and others let gpt use AI to generate the entire email, which results in poor outbound email quality since SDRs/BDRs don't have fine-tune controls on the personalization.",

That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup.\r\n\r\nThe shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that. But, the open-source AI stack is a complete mess, with companies needing a team of engineers to set up 10+ different tools just to get started and every optimization needs countless engineering hours.\r\n\r\nPipeshift offers this stack out of the box. With our fine-tuning + distilling platform and one-click deployment stack for hosting these LLMs, we ensure 10x faster experimentation cycles and time-to-production.

Traditional call centers charge between $1 and $2 per minute, depending on the complexity of the service. Thus, we estimate the total addressable market for inbound calls alone to exceed $26 billion a year. This does not even account for future opportunities in outbound calls.\r\n\r\nBefore launching Sandra, the founding team spent years working in the automotive and call center industries during their time at McKinsey.

It will read and write to files in your project to produce the code you want.\r\n\r\nCodebuff is different from all the other coding agents, we swear!\r\n\r\nWhy it's cool:\r\n- **It chooses files to read automatically on each message** — unlike Cursor’s composer feature. This saves you time and makes Codebuff respond more comprehensively.\r\n- **It takes 0 clicks** — type your instructions and Codebuff will edit your files directly. It's simple and fast. Theoretically, you can do all your development by just chatting with it!\r\n- **It has full access to your terminal** — Codebuff can run terminal commands to install packages, run tests, check for type errors, etc. Codebuff is an engineer working for you.",
