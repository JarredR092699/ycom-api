    "long_description": "91Squarefeet is solving the coordination problem in interior projects. These projects require high-frequency coordination over a small time window, and we have found a neat solution. \r\n\r\nOur tech, Rdash.io, onboarded 150 organizations in its first 12 months. ICICI Bank, Shopper Stop, and Simpliwork use it for project tracking, subcontracting, and procurement. Monthly, $15Mn projects are created and $5Mn procurement happens on Rdash. Companies that are using Rdash typically save 10% in their fit-out expenditure. \r\n\r\nOn the back of this tech, we have scaled our business of building offices and retail shops to $10Mn Annualised Revenue. We have built 1100+ offices and retail shops for MongoDB, HSBC, Calvin Klein, and 60 other customers. \r\n",

    "long_description": "DraftAid is the world's first generative AI for CAD manufacturing drawings, akin to GitHub Copilot but for CAD. It drastically shortens drawing creation time, turning hours into seconds.\r\n\r\nEvery product that is manufactured - from construction to aerospace, automotive, durable goods, and electronics—relies on drawings. Currently, engineers and designers painstakingly make these essential drawings manually. Draftaid streamlines this process saving teams millions in time and quality. \r\n\r\nThe idea was born out of Abdullah's experience as a mechanical design team member, where he created thousands of drawings and longed for a more efficient process. Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",
