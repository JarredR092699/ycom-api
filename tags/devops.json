At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. \r\n\r\nEnter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.\r\n\r\nBig companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone. \r\n\r\nGive it a try at www.neptune.io",

It is intended to be extremely flexible in order to solve pretty much everyone’s needs, but it can take a ton of work and many auxiliary tools to get there.\r\n\r\nAs companies grow, they spend a lot on DevOps or Platform Engineers that try to reduce the burden on developers by gluing together all the 3p tools via custom internal tools.\r\n\r\nWe are building an “internal developer platform” out of the box, with best practices and golden paths for building and operating services on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nWe do the research on the latest and greatest tools in the extremely vibrant ecosystem, and automatically integrate for you the tools you want to use.\r\n\r\nWe operate on our customers code and in your Cloud environment, so they never locked in and never restricted, as is common with classic PaaS offerings.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a fully hosted environment like Heroku, Fly or Vercel, we’ll host a cluster for you and offer you a one-click migration to your own cluster when you want.",
