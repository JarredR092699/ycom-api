After spending 15+ combined years at companies like Facebook, Slack, Brex and Salesforce, they understood what it took to enable talent teams do their best work, and are building a product to scale alongside them as they grow.\r\n\r\nWe created ModernLoop to serve companies of all sizes in every industry to help Talent teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and enhance productivity of teams as they continue their search for top talent!",

As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.\r\n\r\nAt Hirebolt we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, we’ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders.",

We scale non-scalable interviews.\r\n\r\nSince traditional AI interviews rely on a pre-determined question-and-answer format, they are inadequate to conduct complex business case and role-play interviews.\r\n\r\nMindely sets a new norm by mastering complex reasoning situations, real-time adaptive answers and human-like, unscripted interactions:\r\n1. For knowledge workers (Consultants, financial analysts…), Mindely conducts robust business case interviews, testing e.g., candidates’ problem solving skills, structured approach and creativity. This cuts hundreds of hours of interviewing handled by senior managers, that represent an opportunity cost of up to ~$500/hour and a risk of inconsistent assessments due to interviewer fatigue.\r\n2. For customer-facing roles (CSR, Account manager, Salesperson…), Mindely conducts role-play interviews, testing e.g., candidates’ real-time scenario handling, quick thinking skills and customer relation skills. This ensures new hires have what it takes to perform on the job.\r\n\r\nMindely deploys smart, hyper-customizable and unbiased interviews 24/7.
