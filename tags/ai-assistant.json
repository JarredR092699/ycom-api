But browsers weren't built for teams 😔. \r\n\r\nThis leads to a bunch of problems like:\r\n- Knowledge/info that is hard to find (links that get lost, documentation that gets, buried, silos, etc)\r\n- Poor collaboration\r\n- Inefficient workflows\r\n\r\nLinkGrep is an AI browser copilot that solves those problems by making your browser team friendly.\r\n\r\nSpecifically we help teams:\r\n1. 🔗 Keep track of links, documents, and more automatically. With LinkGrep you'll never have to manually add or save a link.\r\n2. 🔍 Find information that matters. LinkGrep connects with your existing tools like Notion and Slack and will automatically suggest relevant information to you as your browse (we have semantic search that you can fallback on). Demo: https://youtu.be/jwcPGDRy4oQ\r\n3. 👥 Collaborate better. LinkGrep lets you leave notes and comments directly on web pages — you won't ever have to copy paste a link into Slack ever again. \r\n4. 🤖 Automate team actions like opening up the right links before a meeting. Never disrupt a meeting to send a link again. Demo: https://youtu.be/an3VKpAWft0",

There's so much advice that you don't even know who to listen to. With Socap.ai, we make it at least 2 times easier by giving founders a proven YC-style \"parallel fundraising\" playbook (remember — we ourselves have raised over $200M using it), an accountable community, and exclusive access to the Socap.ai platform where you can easily manage and grow your founder/investor network for your fundraising needs and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe're currently in beta and onboarding users through various community initiatives (ours or our VC/accelerator partners).

Yuma provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to customer service and e-commerce.\r\n\r\nWe integrate directly with help desk software (Zendesk, Kustomer, Gorgias, etc.) and focus on helping large Shopify merchants deal with their high volume of support requests.\r\n\r\nTop merchants using Yuma can automate up to 60% of their support tickets fully autonomously.\r\n\r\n## Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of large Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year. Most of them have taken over some niches and are great at what they do: selling their products.\r\n\r\nBut they all have one thing in common: they all hate customer support. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost, as they receive hundreds of requests per day. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor while staff turnover remains high.\r\n\r\nThose merchants have been promised automation for years but have always been disappointed by the outcome. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so this is no secret, and everyone knows that the current state of the technology is quite bad.\r\n\r\n## Yuma is solving this in a few ways:\r\n\r\nYuma isn't just another RAG chatbot. Our platform provides autonomous AI agents dedicated to support and ecommerce.\r\n\r\nThese agents are powered by knowledge, follow processes, and are managed by our in-house AI orchestration technology. This ensures safety, control, and quality at every step.\r\n\r\nWe believe that to truly automate customer support, we must develop a platform that mimics the actions of a human support agent. That's exactly what we've been doing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, our top merchants are automating 60% of their support tickets through Yuma. Yuma can fetch information from external services and take actions in other apps as needed to resolve each ticket.\r\n\r\nWe are laser-focused on building the best AI support agent platform and aim to achieve 80% true automation in the next few months.\r\n\r\n## Fun Fact\r\n\r\nYuma got started by accident. This is my third YC startup after Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). I released Yuma as a prototype for fun in mid-December 2022 and was overwhelmed with demo requests. That's when I knew I was onto something and had to turn this into a real company, once again.",

Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",

In the US e-commerce market alone, there are 10B transactions every year, representing a significant opportunity for us.

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial and error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\r\n\r\nOur Approach: \r\nIn our research we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in experimental burden and cost when compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to human experimentalists through our user-friendly no-code software platform, and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.\r\n\r\nOur Background: \r\nWe recently completed our PhDs in Machine Learning for Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. We built an automated lab to validate our optimization strategies during our studies, and are now working to accelerate and automate chemistry & biotech.",

    "long_description": "Henry is an AI copilot for commercial real estate (CRE) brokers that seamlessly integrates a brokerage’s internal data set with external sources to generate custom presentations and financial modeling for deals. Our mission is to help CRE brokers close more deals faster, earning more while doing less repetitive work. We’re initially focusing on enabling brokers to generate deal decks in seconds—a task that typically consumes 20+ hours a week across multiple departments within a brokerage.\r\n\r\nThe long term vision is to take all of these brokerages' unstructured data and build the most powerful CRE database on the planet. Because brokers are involved at the heart of every CRE transaction, we are capturing this transaction data at the source, where no data company in the industry can access. The more brokerages leveraging Henry on transactions, the more unstructured data Henry can ingest. The better the data Henry stores, the better it gets at providing accurate CRE insights and completing brokers' tasks. Eventually, we will topple Costar ($40B market cap) who has a mediocre product relying on call centers to collect data on real estate transactions. Henry will have definitively more accurate, real time data, pulled from both integrations to brokerages internal data (i.e emails and salesforce) and from data emitted by the platform itself (i.e sales comps, unit prices etc.). The plan is to start with building the best in class workflow solution and end up with an impenetrable data moat.",
