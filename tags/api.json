We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.\r\n\r\nToday we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.\r\n\r\nYet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.\r\n\r\nAt Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.\r\n\r\nRight now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!\r\n\r\nWe're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀\r\n\r\nOur Products:\r\n\r\n- Velt Collaboration SDK (https://velt.dev/): JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.\r\n- Superflow (https://usesuperflow.com/): JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.\r\n\r\nWe’re a team of ex-Googlers. We've launched products like Augmented Reality in Google Search & Maps.\r\n\r\nCome build a better web with us 🚀",

Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari.\r\nTailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\nIn today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up.\r\n\r\nTheir monolithic architecture makes it difficult for developers to tailor to the specific needs, even though that's what the enterprises want for ERP. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, legacy ERPs struggle to work well with the variety of cloud-based tools that modern businesses rely on.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding on these challenges, users of old ERP systems often face:\r\n* Hard-to-Use Interfaces: The screens and menus are old school... confusing, slowing down your work.\r\n* Wrong Set of Features: Too many unnecessary options for you and not enough of what you actually need.\r\n* Lack of Transparency: It's tough to understand what's happening behind the scenes.\r\n* High Cost: The expense of maintaining these systems eats into your budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Solution**\r\n\r\nWhy Headless?\r\n\r\n- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients\r\n- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to our clients?\r\n\r\n- Faster development\r\n- Reduced maintenance cost\r\n- Well-documented backend APIs\r\n\r\nTailor’s key capabilities:\r\n\r\n- GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development\r\n- Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises\r\n- Customizable workflows depending on the client's specific business process\r\n- Directory service that can reflect complex organizational structure (e.g. matrix organization) to the workflow",

    "long_description": "Sunlight is an API to change the card-on-file with apps and subscription services. Fintechs use Sunlight to automatically make their cards top-of-wallet as soon as they're issued. \r\n\r\nMerchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.\r\n\r\nUntil Sunlight.\r\n\r\nWith our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.\r\n\r\nThe Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more…), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number and CVV code right on the first try!",
