Supplant™ sugars from fiber is a brand-new blend of sugars found naturally in plant fiber. With Supplant™ sugars from fiber, your favorite treats can look, feel and taste like they’re supposed to. Because it’s made from fiber, Supplant™ sugars from fiber is lower in calories, has a lower glycemic response (compared to glucose), and is prebiotic. It’s made by upcycling agricultural side-streams. For example, in corn (maize), it’s made from the cob, not the kernel. In wheat and rice, it’s made from the straw, not the grain. These fiber-rich parts of crops are hugely abundant and don’t typically make their way into the food system.",

Despite $100 billion being spent annually on weed control, weeds still cost the US economy $46B/year. Weeds steal sunlight and nutrients from crops, forcing farmers to choose between higher costs and lower yields. Moreover, many farms still rely on hand labor to control weed growth. The process is slow, expensive, and increasingly difficult due to constant labor shortages (1 out of every 5 US farm positions go unfilled each year). Our robot nicknamed the Field Hand is able to automate one of the worst jobs on a farm and will help healthily feed the world. ",
