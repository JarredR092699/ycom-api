    "long_description": "Every day, teachers struggle to answer all of their students’ questions. Even worse, they’re often unaware of who needs help because some students are too shy to raise hands. Classkick is a free app that eliminates those roadblocks, showing teachers exactly what their students are doing and who has pressed “I need help” on a specific part of their assignment. \r\n\r\nRather than reinvent how students learn or how teachers teach, Classkick facilitates current classroom learning. In Classkick, every student's’ handwriting, whether it’s a 2nd grader drawing a picture or an 11th grader doing physics, appears live to the teacher in a mosaic of working students. The teacher can zoom into any student’s sheet to help them and ask a probing question to redirect their thinking. By the time the student has read and thought through the feedback, the teacher has already swept off and helped 5 others.\r\n\r\nWe are hyper focused on one goal: increase student learning. To achieve this, we listen to educators to truly understand how technology can assist in the learning process.",

We're starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that solve immediate pain points: collecting reviews, attributing customer interactions, and tracking performance. Our customers 5-10x their monthly Google Reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Imagine walking into any local business and experiencing the smoothness of an Apple Store: roaming checkouts, instant transactions, and personalized service - all from a tap on an employee's phone. That's the future we're creating. Our badges are the first step towards a fully integrated, frictionless system for in-person operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost tech ignores field workers. We're fixing that. We're digitizing all operations for local services - from home repairs to restaurants. Our vision: tap your phone anywhere to close a sale, leave a review, or verify service, making every interaction as smooth as buying the latest iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- We have 30 paying customers, including one enterprise pilot. MRR grew from $1,400 to $4,750 in two months. We've processed over 3,000 reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFounded by Dylan Allen and Ernesto Valencia, CS grads from BYU with experience at Microsoft and Amazon. We're expanding into scheduling, payments, and full workforce management. Our goal: become the central platform for in-person work, serving millions of field employees and revolutionizing how local businesses operate.",
