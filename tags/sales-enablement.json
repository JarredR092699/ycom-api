    "long_description": "Imagine that your company had an extremely knowledgeable employee who’d been at your company since its inception. This employee would have perfect awareness of all of the product features and workflows, and they know all of your customers. They’ve attended every meeting with every customer and read every single support ticket. They’ve read every word of product documentation and listened to every meeting in which any use case for your products have been described.\r\n\r\nSenta and Mihir are building Overstand: the AI manifestation of this omniscient employee. With Overstand, no revenue is left on the table due to “not knowing” about an opportunity. Overstand is able to match any expressed customer interest to its entire product understanding, ensuring that opportunities for upsell or cross-sell are clearly identified and surfaced to those responsible for account expansion.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to upsell your existing customer accounts, email founders@overstandlabs.com to schedule a demo.",

Advisors often waste 60 hours of business development to convert 1 new client.  \r\n\r\nAt FINNY, we are certain we can do better with AI. With our tool, advisors can:\r\n- Identify prospects within their target niche, aggregating thousands of data points per lead\r\n- Prioritize prospects based on their predicted likelihood of converting, a score unique to each advisor and prospect pair\r\n- Automate the outreach and meeting scheduling with their high priority prospects\r\n\r\nIn essence, doing all the work for the advisors, and letting them focus on what actually matters, the client relationship.",

Our agents analyze sales calls, generate tailored collateral, and follow up until the deal is closed.\r\n\r\nThe founders met at UC Berkeley, and at our last jobs, we saw that the best sales reps weren’t just great at selling—they were elite content creators. They crafted tailored collateral like decks and highlight videos for each buyer, and their champions used this info to advocate for purchasing their product within their companies. \r\n\r\nHowever, because this takes more than 30 minutes per call, even the best reps could only do tailored follow-ups for a few clients, leaving millions in lost deals.\r\n\r\nMica’s agents reduce that time to less than a minute. This lets top performers do A+ work on every deal and helps the rest of the team sell like a top performer.\r\n\r\nSales collateral creation and follow-up is a $11b market in the US but this is just our beachhead. We’ll ship a fleet of agents that automate and eventually replace every other facet of the $80b enterprise sales market.  \r\n\r\n",
