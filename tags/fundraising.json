There's so much advice that you don't even know who to listen to. With Socap.ai, we make it at least 2 times easier by giving founders a proven YC-style \"parallel fundraising\" playbook (remember â€” we ourselves have raised over $200M using it), an accountable community, and exclusive access to the Socap.ai platform where you can easily manage and grow your founder/investor network for your fundraising needs and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe're currently in beta and onboarding users through various community initiatives (ours or our VC/accelerator partners). Learn more and apply to one of our free fundraising bootcamps here: Socap.ai",
