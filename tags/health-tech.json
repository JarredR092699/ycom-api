    "long_description": "It all began in January 2009 when our founders - wandering digital sage Jof and software guru Benjie - released an innocent little app called PushupFu. The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.\n\nSoon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.\n\nAnd the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.\n\nFitfu allows you to:\n\n* Track your motion\n\nUsing the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.\n\n* Celebrate progress with friends\n\nFriends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.\n\n* Discover a new way to stay motivated\n\nThe more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.\n\n* Stay active wherever, whenever\n\nNo more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)\n\n*Lose what you want\n\nParticipate with Fitfu at your level of interest - decide to be gung ho, middle of the road, or simply casual.",

Our first goal is therefore to  bring a novel non-hormonal, on-demand and low cost female contraceptive to the market that will substantially improve their quality of life and well-being. Our second goal is to develop the first ever non-surgical and highly effective non-hormonal contraceptive for men. Currently, male contraception is limited to two main options – vasectomy or condoms. Having such options available to both women and men will globally allow for much better family planning, reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies including abortions and therefore reduce costs and ensure contraceptive health and well-being.",

Our online program is 3X more effective at 1/4th the cost.\r\n\r\nThe user receives bi-weekly 1-1 coaching focused on behavioral changes, online community for support and motivation, and a mobile app that provides educational lessons, lifestyle tracking tools and weekly challenges (gamification). The content and behavioral change techniques are centred around healthy diet, fitness, lifestyle and stress reduction.\r\n\r\nOur unique coaching methodology employs cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), goal-oriented treatment and self-efficacy enhancement. The coach helps the user bust negative emotions of past failures in weight-loss and increase motivation by linking short-term achievable goals with the user's personal values. Through the program, the user is able to self-identify triggers of unhealthy habit adoption and make better decisions.\r\n\r\nBreathe Well-being has demonstrated success in helping people lose weight, build long-term healthy habits and reduce/eliminate medication for lifestyle diseases (example - Type 2 Diabetes). We are looking for ideas to improve our sales processes so that we can get users to enrol at a higher conversion rate post our 1-week free trial. We need to identify triggers when users are most likely to pay and provide them with a seamless process for paying on-the-spot.",

Worse, payor systems don't communicate with provider EMRs, so providers are forced to do a lot of manual work between them to get paid. This results in providers spending $300 Billion a year to get paid, and ultimately collect less money than what they are owed.\r\n\r\nCoreCare aggregates administrative patient data from all systems providers work with (EHR, Gov, Payer), standardizes it in our Enterprise Data Warehouse and creates a single net view of administrative patient data for the provider. Then we add workflow automations (according to client specifications) to eliminate the manual work providers are forced to do to get paid. ",

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.\r\n\r\nThe Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.\r\n\r\nResearch from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.\r\n\r\nOsmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.",

NICUs are time sensitive wards in the hospital, time is everything and yet nurses today continue to prepare frozen milk for infants in what's known as the milk shift. A shift where the nurse spends the day defrosting milk for the next shift of nurses. Our tech is now fully peer reviewed and published, yielding safe and reliable results in over 20 hospitals in the New York Tri-State. The company is headed by Vansh Langer MD, a physician (Windsor University, University of Chicago) and Blanca Aguilar Uscanga PhD, a Bioengineering/Food Science PhD (University of Guadalajara /Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías (CUCEI)) team that has over 50 published works in the field between them and are experts in the science of infant nutrition. Vansh saw the immense need for a time critical solution in the NICU and helped solve the puzzle with Dra. Blanca and her team and decided to work together to: Nurture the Future.",

Kabilah improves the patient handoff workflow by replacing commonplace paper report sheets with AI-powered advocates for each patient. Within seconds, nurses can get up to date on patient medical histories via generated summaries and interactive chats with EHR data. A dynamic set of components allows for customized advocates, only displaying pertinent information about each patient. At the end of each shift, a single click allows the outgoing nurse to send auto-generated patient handoff notes. Not only is Kabilah elevating efficiency while alleviating burnout, but it's also empowering nurses to improve patient outcomes.\r\n",
