The exact security scheme applied to data is defined by policies that align with an organization’s existing InfoSec program.\r\n\r\nJumpWire helps companies who maintain information security with compliance programs such as SOC or HIPAA. They are processing sensitive data, often from their own customers, and exceed security best practices as a competitive advantage. JumpWire provides defense at depth to data and sits alongside access controls and Layer 4 encryption to provide a comprehensive data security solution.\r\n\r\nJumpWire is unique from solutions such as data vaults by installing inside our customers’ own infrastructure and clouds. It is interoperable with existing applications and databases, which eliminates the need for large data migrations or code refactoring. Lower-level approaches to data security, such as encryption at rest, are too blunt and lack the ability to differentiate between properties in the data itself. Its scope is limited to physical storage, and security is lost as soon as an application or query loads the data.",

Powered by cutting-edge database tech, Snowpilot lets non-technical users join datasets and query live across billions of rows, with data automatically pulled in from tools like Salesforce, Zendesk, Gong, and Posthog.\r\n\r\nBen and Dom met at a Sequoia & a16z-backed data startup, Census. Together, we built the first real-time, warehouse-native customer data platform. Prior to that, Dom led 20+ ML engineers at Adobe to build their internal ad optimization platform, which allocates $1B in annual spend. Ben built the microservices stack powering the new Microsoft Edge, scaling from 0 to hundreds of millions of DAUs.\r\n\r\nWe started coding Snowpilot two weeks ago (mid-August '24), and we already have a live demo app that can run sub-second queries on millions of rows, entirely in the user's browser.\r\n\r\nThe data warehouse market is $10B/yr, growing 23% YOY. We will disrupt incumbents and significantly expand this market by enabling non-engineers to use the data warehouse on a daily basis.",
