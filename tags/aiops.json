    "long_description": "Neptune is an observability startup that offers one-stop incident enrichment and automation platform for IT Operations and DevOps teams.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of life that servers and applications go down causing IT outages. Today most of the IT incident response is manual, tedious and lengthy resulting in more downtime and losses for businesses. At the same it's very painful for a DevOps engineer to wake up at midnight and on weekends to deal with server and application alerts. \r\n\r\nEnter Neptune, which lets a DevOps engineer automate his incident response steps --Troubleshooting + Resolution + Documentation,  so that he/she can fix the incidents in minutes instead of hours. So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.\r\n\r\nBig companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency. We have architected and built one such tool for AWS. Now Neptune is making one such tool available for everyone. \r\n\r\nGive it a try at www.neptune.io",

Currently, we are focused on helping radiology AI teams prepare high-quality datasets to train their algorithms.\r\n\r\nRadiology data, such as CT and X-ray scans, is an incredibly important source of truth in healthcare delivery. In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare! However, a key hindrance to further adoption is the lack of sophisticated tools to build and deploy AI algorithms in clinical environments. This is the problem we’re focused on at RedBrick AI\r\n\r\nWe're a team based out of Bangalore India, and USA. We're backed by leading institutional investors like Y Combinator and Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Capital India). ",

    "long_description": "We make it easy for AI agents to buy anything on the internet. For example, if a user asked an AI agent to buy a book on an e-commerce site, we handle the purchase via our Purchasing API. \r\n\r\nAI agents are poised to elevate the way we shop, but they aren’t reliably making purchases today. We’re changing that by bringing uniformity to non-uniform checkout flows across the internet.\r\n\r\nOur expertise is at the intersection of payments and e-commerce. Angelica was a staff engineer at Stripe, driving API evolution, design, and governance across payments products. Scott was a senior investor at Sycamore Partners, investing in and partnering with leading consumer companies. \r\n\r\nOur solution will enable AI agents to make payments of every kind, including e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, eBay), consumer services (e.g., Uber, DoorDash), and B2B (e.g., supplier payment). In the US e-commerce market alone, there are 10B transactions every year, representing a significant opportunity for us. We have already onboarded multiple AI agent customers who have thousands of monthly users and have begun integrating them to power their e-commerce purchases. ",

Together, they built AI products that bootstrapped the company profitably to $100MM in Revenue.\r\n\r\nAlex experienced firsthand the broken developer experience in AI while building enterprise infrastructure at Yardi. Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple AI features. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct. Within a week we had two paying customers even before launching our first prototype.\r\n\r\nVoker is built for product specialists who know they can delight their users with AI but can't spend engineering bandwidth on building those features. By making AI accessible and practical, Voker helps these businesses profit from this new wave of innovation. ",

With Pipeshift, companies making >1000 calls/day on frontier LLMs can use their data and logs to replace GPT/Claude in production with specialized LLMs that offer higher accuracy, lower latencies, and model ownership.\r\n\r\nWe are experts in LLMs, having scaled LLMs to 1000s of users in 2023. That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup.\r\n\r\nThe shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that. But, the open-source AI stack is a complete mess, with companies needing a team of engineers to set up 10+ different tools just to get started and every optimization needs countless engineering hours.\r\n\r\nPipeshift offers this stack out of the box. With our fine-tuning + distilling platform and one-click deployment stack for hosting these LLMs, we ensure 10x faster experimentation cycles and time-to-production.
