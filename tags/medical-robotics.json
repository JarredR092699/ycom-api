Our product allows children with disabilities like Cerebral Palsy, to walk, in many cases for the first time in their lives. Trexo was started when Manmeet found that his nephew was born with Cerebral Palsy and would never be able to walk. They are already commercial with customers all over US and Canada. Their vision is to replace the wheelchair, for children, adults, and the elderly. ",
