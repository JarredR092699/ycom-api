Organizations have little incentive to grow these teams, which leads to burnout and inefficiency.\r\n\r\nKairo scales this support staff by recording their actions and translating them into instructions for our agents to execute on their own. Organizations can deploy these agents for any care delivery workflow, such as calling patients to check-in on their symptoms, rescheduling a clinician’s panel in case of an emergency, and filling late cancellation slots with other patients.",
