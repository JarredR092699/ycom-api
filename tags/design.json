Developers using visual AI models at scale use Vango to learn quantitative ways to improve their model, saving them ~10 hours per week. \r\n\r\nMajor companies building visual products have already begun integrating diffusion models, including Adobe, Disney, Activision Blizzard, Canva, and Snap. By 2025, it is estimated that 1 billion images per day will be AI-generated. ",

Currently, engineers and designers painstakingly make these essential drawings manually. Draftaid streamlines this process saving teams millions in time and quality. \r\n\r\nThe idea was born out of Abdullah's experience as a mechanical design team member, where he created thousands of drawings and longed for a more efficient process. Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",
