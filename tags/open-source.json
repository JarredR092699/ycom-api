This makes the software lifecycle 200% faster, radically improving the speed of business.\r\n\r\nGitLab and Concurrent DevOps collapses cycle times by driving higher efficiency across all stages of the software development lifecycle. For the first time, Product, Development, QA, Security, and Operations teams can work concurrently in a single application.

By implementing Vue Storefront, you will improve your overall User Experience and lift up your revenues by at least 20%. \r\n\r\n1. Lightning Fast\r\nWe are on a mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  \r\na) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. \r\nb) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  \r\nc) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. \r\n\r\nLoading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  \r\na) Walmart found that for every 1-second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  \r\nb) Increase of conversion % at each stage of the Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) \r\n\r\n2. Fast Time To Value\r\nVue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS, or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those APIs by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. \r\n\r\nAlso, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. \r\n\r\n3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS\r\nHeadless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. \r\n\r\nIt allows business users to edit the content & publish with a no-code approach\r\n\r\n4. Fast learning curve for developers  \r\nWe use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently the 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!\r\nhttps://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/\r\nhttps://www.vuestorefront.io/",

    "long_description": "GrowthBook is an open source platform to help companies make data-driven product decisions with feature flags and A/B tests.  \r\n\r\nExisting SaaS solutions like LaunchDarkly require a company to send all of their data to them. This results in high costs, data compliance issues, and vendor lock-in.  As a result, many companies end up building their own platforms in-house, which can take thousands of hours of work and lots of headaches.  To solve this, GrowthBook uses a company's existing data infrastructure and business metrics.\r\n\r\nWe believe feature flags and experimentation are the right way to build products at scale and that they will become a standard part of the development process.  GrowthBook is well positioned to be a leader in this growing market.",

This is the first step towards laying the foundations for Composable AI Systems; all AI systems need observability and introspection to be first class for them to be reliable.\r\n\r\nHow? We're standardizing how people write python to express data, ML, LLM, & agent workflows/pipelines/applications with lightweight frameworks. So that no matter the author, it'll be easy to collaborate, connect, and importantly in one line integrate observability and datastore needs. This speeds up time to production and reduces TCO because code remains easy to maintain and your data flywheel stays manageable. So you can increase the top line & bottom line of your business by delivering on AI that is reliable.\r\n\r\nWe've got two open source projects:\r\n- one focused on AI applications, called Burr (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr).\r\n- one focused on AI pipelines/workflows, called Hamilton (https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) see https://www.tryhamilton.dev\r\n\r\nBoth Hamilton & Burr come with self-hostable UIs (+ enterprise & SaaS offerings). With a one-line code change, you get versioning, lineage / tracing, cataloging, and observability out of the box with Hamilton. With Burr you get tracing, observability and persistence in a single line addition.\r\n",
