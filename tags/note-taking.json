It allows busy people to quickly capture thoughts, secure time in their calendar to work on important tasks, schedule meetings, take notes but also quickly glance at their calendar to know when is their next meeting.\r\n\r\nRoutine has been created in 2020 by Julien Quintard and Quentin Hocquet, serial entrepreneurs who previously founded Infinit which they sold to [Docker](http://www.docker.com) in 2016.",
