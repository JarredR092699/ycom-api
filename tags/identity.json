    "long_description": "We build tools that allows enterprises verify information about a user *before* processing it - whether it is processed by a human or an AI agent.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, these verifications including but not limited to background checks cost ~$10. Using our advancements in AI and Cryptography, we're able to send that cost to a few cents. \r\n\r\nThis enables enterprises to do verification at scale, earlier in their work-flows, and enables new kinds of businesses - which were not performing these verifications because of prohibitively high costs.\r\n\r\nFor example, it makes no sense that a recruiter does a candidate's document verification and background checks AFTER the candidate has cleared all the interviews. That's because that verification is cumbersome and expensive. They can't afford to verify all the candidates at the top of the funnel. Many such workflows are ripe for disruption. \r\n\r\nAnother example of a product that was not possible before. A dating app uses our tools to verify the users' information - including their employment, education and financial background. This was something that would have been too expensive to verify at a $10 pricepoint where the ARPU is only $8. \r\n\r\nNot only that, we're designing the tools ground up - so that AI agents can utilize these verifications before ingesting information, so that they take action basis truthful information.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 tools\r\n1. BlueCheck : our flagship product for background verification. The cheapest option to verify users' employment, education and financial background. A few cents instead of a few tens of dollars. Several Billion Dollar+ revenue companies are customers. A solution designed for enterprises that works out of the box!\r\n2. Reclaim Protocol : our underlying infrastructure that makes BlueCheck possible. With advancements in cryptography, specifically zero knowledge proofs - our research over the last 3 years have resulted in inventing a new cryptographic primitive called zkTLS, which allows us to verify information from any website using the cryptography of the existing internet pipes (TLS). This is our secret sauce!\r\n3. Questbook : our dog-fooding tool. Questbook is a tool to give out research and open source software development grants. These grants are reviewed by AI agents that we built inhouse. The biggest scam people try is to fake who they are when they are applying for grants. We dog-food our own tools to make sure we verify all the claims the users are making when they apply for grants. Our tools secure more than $10M of grants being given out on the platform. So it's high stakes, and it works!",

    "long_description": "Notebook solves the Web3 identity problem by using Zero-Knowledge to provide both anonymous proof-of-humanity and credential aggregation. Notebook initially verifies users’ identifying information to ensure that each person has just a single Notebook. Neither Notebook, nor any other company knows the link between a user’s personal information and their Notebook. Once a user’s Notebook account is created they can begin proving their humanity and aggregating their credentials across wallets.\r\n\r\nNotebook can be used to increase the safety of DeFi, governance, and airdrops. With Notebook, creators and communities can run Sybil-resistant airdrops, DAOs can verify the humanity and aggregate the credentials of participants, and lending protocols can build credit scoring systems to offer lower-collateralized loans.
