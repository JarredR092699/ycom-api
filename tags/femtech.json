But it’s hard to believe that, despite all the technology available, we still do not know our baby without a visit to the doctor or hospitals. Which is time consuming, expensive, and stressful.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we created Modoo. \r\n\r\nMothers simply wear the device on their belly. It tracks baby’s heart rate, movements and generates baby’s health report, so we can consult a physician with just one click.\r\n\r\nModoo connects to an app that allows users to share data via social media sites like WeChat and Weibo, which makes it easy to help family and friends feel more connected.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks to the information it collects, our users reported that, it has helped preventing the loss of 73 babies so far. \r\n\r\nWe has been selling Modoo in China at price of 200 dollars since 2017. last year, we tripled our revenue to 3.4 million dollars. \r\n\r\nTo target at a bigger market, we launched a subscription trial 3 months ago, with an initial price of 60 dollars. It’s growing 69% week on week, and already generating 50 thousand dollars in MRR. \r\n\r\nPregnancy is a lucrative market. 16 million babies are born in China every year, that’s a $3.2 billion dollars home market. Worldwide 140 million births make a 28 billion dollars market.\r\n\r\nAbout us, Jiliang is the no.1 employee in an AI startup backed by Google & Sequoia. Ying, the CTO has over 20 years experience in mobile tech with some of the world’s leading companies. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, we are Modoo, the wearable fetal heath monitor company.

LunaJoy utilizes technology and data science to provide intelligent touchpoints that decrease costs and accelerate outcomes. We are increasing our in-network footprint to provide truly accessible care for all. \r\n\r\nWomen are twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties. Rates are even higher for women of color and LGBTQ+ folks. Women are 3x more likely to experience sexual, physical, emotional trauma which is a predictor for mental illness. This is just the tip of the iceberg! Physiologically, women experience hormonal fluctuations which make them more vulnerable to mental health issues during times of transition such as puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. We also face unique stressors as the emotional bedrock of our homes, supporting young families, elderly adults, and a huge part of the workforce. The downstream effects of this gap in care are far-reaching into our ecosystems. Currently, mental health care is expensive, inconvenient, and generalist where a specialized approach is needed.
