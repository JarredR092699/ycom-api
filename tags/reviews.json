Then, you scroll through dozens of restaurant and finally, you decide between hundreds of dishes. And even if you choose the right restaurant, you might get the wrong dishes.\r\n\r\nOn Simmer, we tell you the best reviewed dishes across all delivery apps. You first choose your dish on Simmer, and the delivery companies just take care of logistics. Through this, we are able to charge affiliate revenue for every order.\r\n\r\nNo one has done this before because determining a city’s best dishes requires millions of users to leave dish reviews.\r\n\r\nOur unique insight is that all the data required already exists online, in blog posts, social media, newspapers. It just needs to be aggregated, analyzed, and indexed. We have built a custom sentiment analyzer to do just that.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to be the first place people go when ordering delivery. \r\n\r\nThe founders have backgrounds in engineering and data science from UChicago (their alma mater) and they have both worked at food tech companies like Lolli and Pops and Blue Apron.",

We're starting with NFC-enabled employee badges that solve immediate pain points: collecting reviews, accepting payments, attributing customer interactions, and tracking performance. Our customers 5-10x their monthly Google Reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Imagine walking into any local business and experiencing the smoothness of an Apple Store: roaming checkouts, instant transactions, and personalized service - all from a tap on an employee's phone. That's the future we're creating. Our badges are the first step towards a fully integrated, frictionless system for in-person operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost tech ignores field workers. We're fixing that. We're digitizing all operations for local services - from home repairs to restaurants. Our vision: tap your phone anywhere to close a sale, leave a review, or verify service, making every interaction as smooth as buying the latest iPhone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- We have over 30 paying customers, including one enterprise pilot. MRR grew from $1,400 to $10,000+ in three months. We've processed over 3,000 reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're expanding into scheduling, payments, and full workforce management. Our goal: become the central platform for in-person work, serving millions of field employees and revolutionizing how local businesses operate.",
