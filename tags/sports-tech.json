One founder put on 45 lbs muscle, and another put on 25 lbs of muscle while losing 50 lbs of fat. Our alpha testers lost an average of 12.6 pounds in 3 months.\r\n\r\nOur core technology distills messy academic literature into simulations. Before turning to our own fitness journeys, we successfully deployed sophisticated enterprise models of plant-soil-atmosphere, consumer behavior and battery electrochemistry. With BODYSIM we built a science-based simulation of macronutrient balance and muscle hypertrophy. It includes cell turnover, oxidation for energy, lipolysis of fat stores, synthesis of new muscle, glycogen resynthesis, GI latency, and even ketones. Get jacked at BODYSIM.com\r\n",
