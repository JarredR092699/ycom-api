    "long_description": "Centauri AI is a modern ETL and Data Science platform for banks and investment firms, starting with Structured Finance. \r\n\r\nFinancial firms heavily rely on Excel, PDF, and PPT files to exchange complex asset details, leading analysts to spend hours crunching the files and extracting insights. Moreover, these data files and reports cannot be easily reused due to poor data infrastructure. \r\n\r\nPowered by AI, our product cuts hours of data wrangling work down to minutes and makes it possible to query past data easily. This helps firms evaluate assets faster and win more deals.\r\n\r\nSince launching last month, we've started a pilot with a brokerage team at a public investment bank that now uses our product daily. Aiming to serve over 100,000 investment teams needing complex data analysis for alternative investments, this opens up a potential $5 billion market.",

We have one-click integrations, warehousing, transformation, and schedules all built in.\r\n• Seamless integrations: Plug in your Postgres database, Stripe transactions, Hubspot leads, or any other data source, without writing code to keep things in sync.\r\n• Thoughtful AI: We love Cursor and we love data – we combined the two to help you write accurate queries. We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds. Git and branching are built-in for both code and data, so you can time-travel backwards when things break. You can start with GBs and grow to TBs.",

This eliminates the concept of day-to-day firefighting, and results in prolonged machine life, reduced production downtimes, and improved product quality.\r\n\r\nOur simplified interface enables manufacturing teams with minimal data science knowledge to create custom complex models on the machinery they know is critical to their operations. We walk them through the process of connecting to their data, configuring and building a model, deploying a model, and finally operationalizing a model using our copilot Max.e.\r\n\r\nOnce configured, Praxis AI and Max.e directly integrate into your existing workflows. For example once a downtime prediction model has been configured for a machine, Max.e will monitor and alert when a threshold is reached and provide you with an automated root cause analysis to resolve the issue. Early results have shown that Praxis can help manufacturers reduce their unplanned production downtimes by as much as 25%. \r\n\r\nExisting solutions focus on dashboards and complex charts. We know that dashboards don't cut costs, actions do. Praxis AI takes care of the complex machine learning and enables manufacturing engineers to focus on the important task of actually running a production floor, but now empowered by data-driven AI insights.",
