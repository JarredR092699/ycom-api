The traditional process looks like this: export a cut from editing software; upload it to a cloud drive; email teammates a link to it; teammates email back comments; editor collates and implements comments; editor exports another cut and the cycle continues ad infinitum. 😴\r\n\r\nThe Problem: Video post production is stuck in yesteryear: the industry primarily uses on-prem, siloed software not built for teams.\r\n\r\nThe Solution:\r\nIt’s 2021: video editing should be cloud-based and collaborative.
