These outdated solutions fail to address government workers’ unique challenges. \n\nSeneca Systems was founded to address those challenges and strengthen the vital bond between government and people. Our Constituent Services Platform, Romulus, centralizes constituent communications, organizes service requests, and provides insights into constituent preferences and work performed. Built for governments by people who love government workers, Romulus enables government workers to get more done in less time, with less overhead, and to more constituent applause.",

    "long_description": "Our goal is to empower local government employees with the tools, technology, and support they need so they can deliver exceptional service to their taxpayers and feel proud of the work they do for their communities. We contribute by building software to streamline local government tax assessors’ workflows using AI. Specifically, we streamline the change of ownership process for real estate and create more seamless ways for tax offices to communicate digitally with their taxpayers.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, when properties get bought and sold, local governments have to process reams of paper in order to update their systems and perform the analyses necessary to update the tax roll. Our software makes this process 10x faster and much more enjoyable for employees in the tax office to complete, and creates trust and goodwill in the minds of taxpayers. ",

Our first deal for $82.5K / month starts next week.\r\n\r\nEach year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from state and federal prisons. Another nine million are released from local jails. Yet, a year after reentry, 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed.  The success of Emerge creates a win-win-win situation: (1) jobs for reentrants, (2) workers for labor-starved industries, and (3) reduction in crime and recidivism.",
