Users press a button in their browser and their card-on-file everywhere instantly switches to their shiny new card (our partner's card!).\r\n\r\n😌 Making Checkout Seamless\r\n\r\n- Our fast checkout technology embeds “One Tap Checkout ” on the checkout page at over 50,000 e-commerce sites - making our partners' cards the easiest way for users to complete any transaction on their browser. \r\n- They can even customize the copy to tell the user why to use your card for that specific purchase. For example Chase could prompt their users to use their Sapphire Preferred card on Avis BECAUSE it offers car rental insurance.\r\n\r\n🤑 Making Our Partners' Cards More Rewarding\r\n- We partner with over 1000 of the country’s top merchants to offer additional affiliate-based cash back that our partners can tack on to their existing cash back. User can now earn double or even triple the cash back on Sephora when they user our partners' “One Tap Checkout” button instead of their other cards.",

At Alt, we were faced with the manual workflows from compliance to servicing that are needed to make and manage consumer loans. And as a result, we spent much of our time and hundreds of thousands of dollars creating robust internal tooling to ensure we were doing things the right way.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the pain of hunting through regulatory codes, confusion of form filling, surprise of regulatory deadlines, monotony of PDF data extraction, anxiety of brittle excel spreadsheets, the frustration of buried email threads with advisors, and the missed phone calls with borrowers to chase payments … to name a few … we knew that this experience needed to be improved. \r\n\r\nSo, we started Finosu to build the tools that we wish we had.\r\n\r\nFinsou is building software to reduce the barriers to entry in lending, beginning with:  outsourced state licensing, default compliant loan management systems, and automated servicing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe operational cost of originating and servicing loans reaches into the tens of billions a year and that is money out of the pocket of lenders, borrowers, investors, and ultimately the consumers as a cost of doing business – we are changing that.",
