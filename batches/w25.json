This allows us to use the same propulsion systems that have been developed by launch vehicles over the last few decades (NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, Relativity Space, ect.).\r\n\r\nBen and Ross met while working together at Relativity Space, where they qualified the cryogenic flight termination valves for the Terran 1 rocket and continued working together on the heat exchangers and turbomachinery for the AeonR engine.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on the first demo of our unique cryo management system and intend to launch an operational vehicle by 2027.
