Our AI software auto-drafts proposals and ensures full compliance.\r\n\r\nWhen we met at Stanford 4 years ago, it was rare for startups to work with the US Government. In the years that we’ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed. Silicon Valley and the US Government are closer than they’ve been in decades.  \r\n\r\nAs fellows in Stanford’s Center for National Security Innovation, we’ve had the privilege of speaking with dozens of government officials who have come to Silicon Valley looking to fund and scale startups solving their most urgent problems. \r\n\r\nHowever, we’ve seen firsthand the struggles these startups face in securing gov funding. Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we’re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\r\n\r\nWe’re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years. With that, there will be increasingly more funding going towards companies in defense, energy, biotech, quantum, etc. Candor lets you unlock that funding potential.\r\n",

Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\r\n\r\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $170B on transportation capital projects, with an estimated 10-15% of that cost going to planning and consultants. This represents an ~$20B market opportunity in the US alone. Through automation, we can redefine the existing transportation and urban planning consulting markets.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit waypointtransit.com or contact us at contact@waypointtransit.com.",

Voice AI has always seemed out of reach for hotels because their technology infrastructure is often fragmented, with reservation systems, loyalty programs, and in-house operations software that weren’t designed with voice AI in mind. Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing hotel software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each hotel and department.\r\n\r\n\r\nHotels spend over $100 billion annually on staffing and lose potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up.

Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\r\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\r\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\r\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor.

He experienced first-hand how silos and poor communication reduced the productivity and efficiencies in the teams he worked at.\r\n\r\nWe love working with companies tackling complex engineering systems, whether they be startups just getting their feet wet or large organizations like Israel Aerospace Industries (Our design partner and biggest aerospace/defense company from Israel)\r\n\r\nRead why we started Dalus: https://dalus.io/articles/why-dalus",

It reads thousands of integrated unstructured financial reports (often 300 pages) to provide source-cited answers, verifiable financial calculations, and Excel-ready tables — tasks that typically take hours.\r\n\r\nWe're initially focusing on boutique investment banks and small private equity firms, covering annual reports of international companies and allowing to upload custom documents. As we develop our product and build clients' trust, we'll eventually integrate directly into clouds.\r\n\r\nUsing accurate extraction and analysis as single unit of work LLMs do, our vision is to scale it with agents to allow deeper and more thoughtful research, report generation and task execution — allowing financial teams to focus on ideas and decisions.",
