Current approaches pursue single-gene fixes that only help small subsets of patients, leaving a multi-million patient population without effective treatment options.\r\n\r\n\r\nGene therapy opens the door to precisely modifying brain circuits. The problem is the elevated risk in neuroscience drug discovery. To solve this, we use a pre-clinical screening platform, multiple gene therapy candidates, and ML analytics to develop gene therapies capable of controlling neural activity and addressing neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease.\r\n\r\n",

We helped grow Carta's fund accounting business from $20M to $100M, transformed offline excel tasks into automated workflows, and increased customer satisfaction score by over 50% by creating an internal workspace for task coordination. \r\n\r\nUntil now, the only way to scale accounting firms was to hire more employees and outsource more work. With Mesh, accountants can save time on each task, save money on hiring additional resources, and use their extra capacity to exponentially grow their business.\r\n\r\nWith a current shortage of 340,000 accountants in the US, along with the alarming statistic that 75% of certified public accountants (CPAs) will reach retirement within the next 15 years, AI has a critical role to play.

This allows us to use the same propulsion systems that have been developed by launch vehicles over the last few decades (NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, Relativity Space, ect.).\r\n\r\nBen and Ross met while working together at Relativity Space, where they qualified the cryogenic flight termination valves for the Terran 1 rocket and continued working together on the heat exchangers and turbomachinery for the AeonR engine.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on the first demo of our unique cryo management system and intend to launch an operational vehicle by 2027.
