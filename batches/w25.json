It learns the style of each individual teacher, so it can grade just like they do, saving up to 100% of grading time.  \r\nEdexia can grade assignments from any curriculum, year level, subject, or format. Learning like a teacher, it visually breaks down its understanding of the rubric, and updates this as a teacher corrects its grading on the fly. \r\nOur vision is to transform education by facilitating the safe and effective integration of AI across all institutions and applications. Not using AI to replace teachers but rather to empower them—providing them with all the time and resources they need to develop their students.",
