In the years that we’ve been involved in the burgeoning Defense Tech ecosystem, a lot has changed. Silicon Valley and the US Government are closer than they’ve been in decades.  \r\n\r\nAs fellows in Stanford’s Center for National Security Innovation, we’ve had the privilege of speaking with dozens of government officials who have come to Silicon Valley looking to fund and scale startups solving their most urgent problems. \r\n\r\nHowever, we’ve seen firsthand the struggles these startups face in securing gov funding. Marcus, having spoken with dozens of defense startups in his time helping lead the Stanford Defense Tech Club and trying to set up a national security startup accelerator has seen this especially.\r\n\r\nThat’s why we’re making it easier to find and apply for opportunities, taking the application process from weeks to days.\r\n\r\nWe’re only going to see more cooperation in the coming years. With that, there will be increasingly more funding going towards companies in defense, energy, biotech, quantum, etc. Candor lets you unlock that funding potential.\r\n",

Clear, accurate, and up-to-date docs are critical, influencing buying decisions, reducing support overhead, and increasing LTV. \r\n\r\nProviders like Readme and Mintlify effectively host your docs, but keeping them updated remains a serious challenge. Working alongside your hosting provider, Promptless lets you configure triggers so that your docs get automatically updated upon new feature releases, developer support questions, or internal use-case discussions. \r\n\r\nPromptless integrates directly with your organization’s entire knowledge ecosystem – issue trackers, internal knowledge bases, support ticket systems, and more – leading to holistic doc updates without expensive coordination between product, engineering, and support teams. \r\n\r\nWith Promptless, documentation becomes a strategic advantage for growth, not a bottleneck or a liability.

Breakeven fusion is coming soon, but the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors will be costly, high maintenance, and have low capacity factors, leading to 5–10x higher electricity cost on the grid. Maritime Fusion is pursuing the most widely accepted approach to fusion, the tokamak, but specifically designed for the marine environment where the challenges that arise between breakeven and a commercially viable energy source are alleviated. The market we're targeting requires 15x less power, lower up-time, and costs the same as alternative fuels but without any emissions. Since fusion does not use highly radioactive fuels or materials – unlike fission – we sidestep the vast majority of regulatory challenges and safety risks associated with nuclear energy. Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.",

The government requires a record for each of the 1.5 million parts in the jet, including what shop-floor workers do to each part and when they do it.\r\n\r\nAutomating paperwork by interpreting human actions with cameras is hard. Doing this at the edge and inside secure aerospace environments is harder.

We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.\r\n\r\nOur multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.\r\n\r\nWe've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.\r\n\r\nEarly metrics show the power of our approach:\r\n\r\n- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates\r\n- 37% improvement in 90-day retention\r\n- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP\r\n- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024\r\n\r\nThe Medicare Advantage market represents a massive opportunity, with over $360B in annual premiums and growing 10% year over year.

By automating geometry conversions and meshing, Nuclear Software eliminates bottlenecks and streamlines workflows, allowing engineers to focus on building better products.\r\n\r\nEvery design change automatically triggers simulations through a unified pipeline, ensuring real-time validation, version control, and traceability. Teams can customize workflows for individual components or run full system simulations, all within the same platform. Nuclear Software securely stores both designs and simulation results in a centralized repository, maintaining a complete version history linked to each design change. This single source of truth makes it easy to track progress, troubleshoot issues, and maintain accountability, reducing the risk of costly mistakes.\r\n\r\nNuclear Software’s robust access control system protects proprietary and regulated simulation codes, ensuring compliance and data security. By automating simulation workflows and connecting design iterations to real-time validation, Nuclear Software accelerates development cycles and empowers engineers to innovate faster and with greater precision.",

Sophris takes it further, analyzing specs and cross-referencing design requirements from multiple sources. As a result, subtle pin misconfigurations, voltage mismatches, and datasheet-specific quirks that typical rule checks might miss are brought to light.\r\n\r\nBy identifying design flaws during the schematic phase, Sophris helps you iterate confidently and deliver more reliable products.

Before founding Waypoint, Varun worked on AI at Microsoft and Ryan worked on chip design at Apple.\r\n\r\nUS cities are facing three major crises: congestion, budget deficits, and climate change. At the same time, city governments are understaffed and frequently need to contract work out to expensive consultants. Leveraging recent advancements in AI, we empower cities to reduce their costs, build infrastructure, and respond to problems quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, state and local governments spend $170B on transportation capital projects, with an estimated 10-15% of that cost going to planning and consultants. This represents an ~$20B market opportunity in the US alone. Through automation, we can redefine the existing transportation and urban planning consulting markets.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit waypointtransit.com or contact us at contact@waypointtransit.com.",

Riviera addresses this by integrating seamlessly with existing hotel software providers and using human-sounding voice models that are highly trained on data specific to each hotel and department.\r\n\r\n\r\nHotels spend over $100 billion annually on staffing and lose potential revenue when phone lines are overwhelmed or callers hang up.

Collectors, investors, and hobbyists currently rely on scattered data from auction houses, online forums, and reseller platforms, making it difficult to know the true value of their items. Misprint streamlines the process by combining accurate pricing analytics with a seamless buy/sell marketplace, making it easier than ever to understand and monetize collectible assets.\r\n\r\nExisting marketplaces lack robust, real-time analytics because accurate valuations require deep expertise in both the collectibles domain and advanced pricing algorithms. Misprint’s unique blend of insider trading card knowledge and machine learning allows us to fill this gap.\r\n\r\nBuilding these pricing models requires extensive data infrastructure, deep domain expertise, and cutting-edge ML. Recent surges in the trading card market show that collectors crave transparent valuations.\r\n\r\nThe global collectibles market is worth tens of billions of dollars. Eva has experienced the scale of this industry firsthand, generating $500k ARR within three months of taking her Pokemon card-selling side hustle full-time. With additional segments like sports cards, comics, and emerging collectible categories, the growth runway is immense.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Eva and Jon have been best friends since Exeter, combining finance expertise, a passion for collectibles, and mathematical rigor. By merging Goldman Sachs-level financial analytics with top-tier mathematical talent, Misprint is uniquely positioned to become the go-to platform for fair, transparent pricing in the collectibles space.",
