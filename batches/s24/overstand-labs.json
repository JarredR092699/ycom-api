  "long_description": "Enterprise software companies are leaving a lot of potential revenue on the table - some offer a whole menu of products, with each customer only taking advantage of one or a few of the offerings.\r\n\r\nOverstand is built to find needs expressed by customers and match those to available products using AI under the hood. This enables companies to effectively identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities, maximize revenue, and improve the experience of their customers by helping them to get more value over time.
