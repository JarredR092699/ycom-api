  "long_description": "Kastle is an AI voice agent for mortgage servicing. We help servicers collect payments, verify new borrowers, and qualify new loan inquiries over the phone. \r\n\r\nRishi and Nitish met at UIUC where they graduated with degrees in systems engineering and computer science.  Rishi was the founding Product Manager for Redfin’s Mortgage Marketplace at age 22 and grew the business from $3M to $6M in revenue in 9 months. Nitish patented Verkada’s motion search system and was the youngest tech lead at the company at age 23.\r\n\r\nWhile building Redfin's Mortgage Marketplace Rishi realized traditional lenders didn't have the infrastructure to service online inquiries and were losing customers. Nitish and Rishi are building Kastle to help traditional financial services companies better interface with their customers. ",
