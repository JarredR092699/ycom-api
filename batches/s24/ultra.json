  "long_description": "Ultra builds AI-powered robots that automate the dull, repetitive labor still done by people in American warehouses. We’re starting with e-commerce order packaging in fulfillment centers — where a worker puts items in a box, seals it, and labels it. Traditional automation isn't working for warehouses because it's costly, rigid, and often underutilized. Ultra’s robots are different: they’re easy to deploy, adaptable, and powered by AI that’s trained through examples.",
