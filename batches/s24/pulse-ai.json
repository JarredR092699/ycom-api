  "long_description": "Pulse AI simplifies the procurement process for mid-market and large enterprises by utilizing LLMs to automate supply chain actions.\r\n\r\nProcessing unstructured data in the form of emails, RFQs, PRs takes up over 40% of supply chain management time. Pulse AI develops recommendations from siloed communication with suppliers by integrating with procurement teams' existing toolsâ€”ranging from email, document suites, and ERPs. \r\n\r\nPulse structures this data to build our search engine (think Glean for supply chain) and automates tasks such as purchase order management, invoice matching for accounts payable, and vendor communications.
