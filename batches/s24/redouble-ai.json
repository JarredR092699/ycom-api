  "long_description": "Companies are increasingly adopting LLMs to automate their workflows, but sufficiently accurate and consistent outputs are hard to obtain, especially in regulated industries where mistakes are costly. As a result, AI companies use human reviewers in production to verify and correct the output of their AI pipelines - which quickly becomes an unsustainable bottleneck. \r\n\r\nOur solution dynamically learns from our clients' unique domain specific human feedback data; provides recommendations whether to send the output of a LLM pipeline to a human for review; monitors the insights obtained from human reviewers at scale, while also flagging suspicious reviews to ensure consistent final outputs; and integrates easily with our clients' existing pipelines via a small number of simple API calls.",
