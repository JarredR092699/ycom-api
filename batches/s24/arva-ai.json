  "long_description": "Every time a business onboards onto a bank or fintech a human analyst has to conduct manual document verification. We replace those human KYB (know your business) analysts with AI agents that handle cases in seconds, not days.\r\n\r\nCurrently, 30% of know your business (KYB) cases result in manual review work. With Arva's AI agents the whole end-to-end onboarding experience is automated. Instant onboarding whilst reducing operational costs by 80%.\r\n\r\nOur end goal is to have a whole suite of AI workers that can handle manual compliance work for banks and fintechs. A $24B opportunity in the US alone.",
