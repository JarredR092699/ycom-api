  "long_description": "LLMs won’t become God...but Invoke Labs is using them to make money for SMBs\r\n\r\nInvoke Labs is a no-code platform that empowers SMBs to build chatbots you can trust to do their job. Companies like Lull.com and Dutch.com are using our development toolkit to increase their bottom line by automating internal processes and elevating their consumer’s experiences. You don’t need AI Engineers, you just need to understand your business.\r\n\r\nAlex and Tyler met at a high-growth E-Commerce startup where Tyler was on the operating team running Technology & Analytics. Together, they built AI products that bootstrapped the company profitably to over $100MM in Revenue.\r\n\r\nAlex experienced firsthand the broken developer experience in AI while building enterprise infrastructure at Yardi. Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple chatbots. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct. Within a week we had two paying customers even before launching our first prototype.  \r\n\r\nInvoke Labs meets SMBs where they are, making AI chatbots accessible and practical, allowing them to profit from this new wave of innovation.
