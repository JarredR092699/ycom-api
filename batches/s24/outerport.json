  "long_description": "Outerport lets companies use their GPUs more efficiently by making it easy for them to be swapped from task to task. Just like how VMWare made it easy to put multiple users on a single server machine, we make it easy to put multiple AI models on a single GPU. Rather than having separate sets of GPUs for each task, you can buy less GPUs and make better use of it.\r\n\r\nHot swap foundation model weights instantly, minimize cold starts, scale horizontally, maintain version control, secure your models on a central registry, perform A/B tests, and save 40% on GPU costs.
