  "long_description": "Sepal AI builds Large Language Models for Enterprises through data development, finetuning, and inference.\r\n\r\nOur team comes from Turing, Vercel, McKinsey, and Bain. At Turing, we built the LLM training business and products to support over $120M revenue growth in 6 months for companies like Open AI, Google, and Anthropic. \r\n\r\nWe learned that large, non-tech enterprises that we worked with, like PepsiCo, Bridgestone, and Volvo, don't have the data they need to train models to produce real value. Which means theyâ€™re not going to unlock the value from AI without a partner.\r\n\r\nWe are targeting the 2400 largest non-software companies to build, continuously fine tune, and deploy their custom models.
