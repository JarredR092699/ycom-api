Our NFC-enabled badges allow employees to better grow positive reviews, gather customer feedback, and take customer payments. Managers gain significant workforce management insights with employee-specific data, effectively managing more aspects of their operations.\r\n\r\nIn just 3 months, our MRR grew from $1.4k to over $10k, and we've already closed our first enterprise client, Vivint Smart Home. We're focusing on larger field service companies, replacing their outdated employee badging systems with our comprehensive solution that seamlessly embeds into their business operations.",
