  "long_description": "Cheers is an in-person experience management platform that empowers service providers—like electricians, restaurants, and solar companies—to revolutionize customer interactions with NFC-enabled ‘Smart’ Badges.\r\n\r\nThese badges go beyond traditional employee identification; they are tap-enabled tools designed to streamline crucial in-person actions such as gathering reviews, collecting leads, verifying employment, and more. By turning every modern smartphone into a frictionless tool for these interactions, Cheers ensures businesses can capture on-the-spot feedback and drive positive reviews, all attributed to specific employees, products, and locations.\r\n\r\nSo far, Cheers has achieved:\r\n\r\n- $50K of ARR in the first ~2 months of operation\r\n- Thousands of new reviews generated across our customer base\r\n- 5-10x increase in feedback and 5-star reviews within the first month\r\n\r\nEmployee-level and product-level attribution fosters a culture of excellence, allowing managers to track performance, host competitions, and provide targeted training—all within a single platform.\r\n\r\nWhile we’re revolutionizing feedback today, our broader vision is to build Cheers into the central operating system for in-person businesses, integrating scheduling, payments, and performance tracking.",
