  "long_description": "Offstream is Vanta for carbon compliance. We have over $350K ARR and 9 customers who are mid-sized clean tech developers. \r\n\r\nZach (CTO) studied CS at Notre Dame and built the entire product at Repool (YC S21). Varsha (CEO) is an HBS grad who launched a traceable cotton product at Indigo Ag and secured contracts for $50M in booked revenue. At Indigo, she hired 80 people and spent $50M to get carbon compliant because it was opaque, time-consuming, and changing rapidly.\r\n\r\nOffstream solves this by using LLMs to parse regulations, generate technical reports for customers, and manage 100,000+ operational data points on projectâ€™s lifecycles. We cut the time customers spend on compliance by 90% and at 1/5th of the cost of alternatives.\r\n\r\nAll new infrastructure built today has carbon compliance requirements and we are just getting started.\r\n",
