  "long_description": "Modern Realty is an AI real estate agent that helps you buy homes without relying on a traditional realtor. Historically, sellers pay a 3% commission to the buyer's agent. However, due to a recent lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, buyers will soon have to pay their agents themselves (which would be an extra $30,000 on a $1 million dollar house). We offer a self service alternative.",
