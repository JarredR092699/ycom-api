  "long_description": "Nowadays, AI-first enzyme design companies are building large generalist models (like Alphafold 3 and Gingko Biowork’s more recent model API). Looking at the benchmarks, it’s clear that even with huge additions of general protein data, performance is converging. Domain-specific models are the only way to get accuracies that we can use reliably – that’s what we’re focused on building.\r\n\r\nOur enzymes are designed using proprietary domain-specific AI models with validated state-of-the-art accuracy. This allows us to intelligently generate new enzymes for health and nutrition that actually work, rather than relying on thousands of random trial-and-error experiments in the lab.",
