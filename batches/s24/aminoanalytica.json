  "long_description": "Biotechs use proteins found in nature, such as enzymes in bacteria or peptides in lizards, in a wide range of applications from chemical manufacturing to therapeutics. However, these naturally occurring proteins aren't optimized for industry.\r\n\r\nAt AminoAnalytica, we specialize in AI-powered protein optimization. Using our proprietary computational tools, we can improve the properties of a target protein sequence, from the stability of therapeutic peptides to the activity of industrial enzymes. When we optimize a protein, it’s not just a theoretical suggestion—we work with labs to ensure that it’s functional, stable, and ready to change the world.",
