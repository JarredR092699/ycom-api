  "long_description": "Creating new functional proteins, like enzymes or therapeutic peptides, has traditionally been an inefficient, costly trial-and-error process. Biotech companies repeatedly mutate and test proteins, hoping for success.\r\n\r\nGeneralist AI protein models, like AlphaFold3 and ESM3, are built work across all fields but lack the precision needed for industrial applications.\r\n\r\nAt AminoAnalytica, we build tailored models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for thousands of wet lab experiments, speeding up breakthroughs in areas like drug development and industrial enzymesâ€”without sacrificing accuracy.",
