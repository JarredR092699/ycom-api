  "long_description": "Creating new functional proteins, such as industrial enzymes or therapeutic peptides, has traditionally been an inefficient and costly ‘trial-and-error’ process. Biotech companies painstakingly make random mutations of existing proteins, test them, and repeat this cycle until success.\r\n\r\nAI ‘de-novo’ protein design promised a breakthrough by generating entirely new proteins from scratch. However, it severely falls short due to a lack of comprehensive data, resulting in poor accuracies that make it unfit for industrial use.\r\n\r\nAt AminoAnalytica, we offer a new approach: accelerated adaptation. Our AI software rapidly predicts protein properties in silico, eliminating the need for thousands of lab tests. This enables us to enhance existing proteins for better industrial performance, transforming the traditional ‘trial-and-error’ method into an ultra-high throughput and intelligent process.",
