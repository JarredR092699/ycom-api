  "long_description": "With autarc we are building the leading heat pump OS for HVAC installers in Europe to accelerate the transition to low carbon homes. Heating with gas and oil accounts for 30% of Europe's CO2 emissions, and we are at the forefront of combating this environmental concern. \r\n\r\nThe problem: Installers are eager to install more heat pumps but are hindered by a broken installation process.\r\n\r\nOur solution leverages LiDAR technology and AI to cut the overall project time of heat pump installations by 50%. We integrate a CRM, planning, and design tool into an all-in-one platform. By capturing hundreds of data points in minutes rather than hours, we empower installers to confidently shift their business to the right technology â€“ heat pumps.",
