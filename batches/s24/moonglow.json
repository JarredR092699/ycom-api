  "long_description": "Moonglow connects local Jupyter notebooks to remote cloud compute. Machine learning researchers and data scientists use us to scale up their experiments without having to do DevOps.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Leila was a software engineer at Jane Street. She led the build-out of its equities clearinghouse connectivity infrastructure and was the technical lead of its front-office SRE team. Trevor was part of Hazy Research Lab at Stanford, and published machine learning research at ACL and ICLR.\r\n\r\nWith the explosive growth of deep learning, there are over 1 million ML researchers who do computationally intensive experiments every day. They use Jupyter notebooks to do so, but every time they want to try out a new idea, they need to get the notebooks running on cloud machines. This process, repeated hundreds of times a month, is time-consuming and error-prone.\r\n\r\nMoonglow reliably brings the time-to-experiment down from 5 minutes to 20 seconds. Just as Vercel and Replit abstracted away the lower levels of the computing stack for web developers and programmers, we do the same for ML researchers.\r\n\r\nhttps://moonglow.ai\r\n",
