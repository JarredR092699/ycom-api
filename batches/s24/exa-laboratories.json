  "long_description": "Exa is making reconfigurable chips for AI, offering superior speed and energy efficiency compared to traditional GPUs/TPUs/LPUs.\r\n\r\nOur chips automatically adapt themselves to each specific AI model, overcoming the von Neumann bottleneck, (a common limitation in standard systems). By optimizing for each AI architecture, we significantly boost both inference and training speeds while reducing energy consumption.\r\n\r\nImagine having hardware tailored to your AI model, whilst still maintaining the flexibility of a GPU. This way, you won't need to re-manufacture your hardware each time you change your model architecture, all while still benefiting from the speed and efficiency of specialized hardware, saving data centers and compute clusters hundreds of millions of dollars every year!",
