  "long_description": "At Brighterway, we use AI to assist physicians in the workers' compensation claims review process. Physicians typically spend significant time reviewing thousands of pages of medical documents– our technology highlights the 10-15% of pages that are relevant, streamlining their review process and saving them time.\r\n\r\nBrighterway structures and deduplicates disorganized medical records (PDFs) and summarizes them down to content related to a doctor's specialty. In our online portal, physicians can view our summaries side-by-side with the original documents, and can filter, edit, and search for specific body parts or visits (i.e. “Clinical Notes” or “Ankle”) that can get them the answers they need in seconds, rather than hours.",
