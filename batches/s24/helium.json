  "long_description": "Helium's AI continuously experiments on monetization surfaces (signup, subscribe, upsell) to increase revenue. \r\n\r\nToday, growth teams use Helium's visual editor to create their in-app paywalls, then our ML system runs automated tests on messaging, experience, and pricing to drive conversion. \r\n\r\nFor example, a social app with 20M MAU uses Helium to generate and test in-app paywalls to get more users to subscribe to their paid offering. \r\n\r\nWe've earned $100M+ building AI conversion tools for Uber and Meta, and started Helium to help other companies do the same.",
