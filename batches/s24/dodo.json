  "long_description": "Dodo provides AI Receptionists tailored for medical practices, starting with vet clinics. \r\n\r\nEvery third veterinary receptionist leaves their job each year. At the same time, the pandemic caused a pet boom, leading to a record demand for vet services. Facing understaffed and undertrained support, clients spend an average of 67% of their call time listening to hold music and phone trees (“press 1 for x”). While waiting to be connected, they take their business elsewhere. \r\n\r\nWe built the first voice agent specifically for vets, finetuned on veterinary knowledge and trained on protocols taken directly from receptionists’ manuals, which often span multiple binders. It answers every call, addresses customer inquiries, and interacts with internal practice software to update patient files, manage schedules, and execute necessary administrative tasks.",
