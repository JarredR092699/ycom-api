  "long_description": "Every third receptionist in specialty clinics leaves their job each year. At the same time, increased demand for specialized care has strained clinic resources. Facing understaffed and undertrained support, clients spend an average of 67% of their call time listening to hold music and navigating phone trees (“press 1 for x”). Frustrated by long wait times, many take their business elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDodo is an AI receptionist for specialty clinics, such as veterinarians and dentists, fine-tuned on industry-specific knowledge and trained on protocols taken directly from receptionists’ manuals, which often span multiple binders. We handle front and back-office tasks, enabling clinics to provide 24/7 service. Dodo answers calls, sends medical records, and refills prescriptions - fully autonomously, with no human in the loop.",
