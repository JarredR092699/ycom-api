  "long_description": "Paasa is the global financial advisor for aspiring HNIs. We simplify access to US markets from emerging economies, while offering an AI advisor and robo-investing.\r\n\r\n‘Pre-HNIs’ and HNIs in countries like India want to diversify their wealth internationally. Most customers hesitate due to lack of guidance on foreign investments, tax laws that change every year, and slow outflows from local banks.\r\n\r\nThese barriers keep global investing out of reach, reserved for the top 0.001% who can afford wealth managers and family offices. We’re changing that.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to bring all the opportunities of the 0.001% to the pre-HNI without any hassle. ",
