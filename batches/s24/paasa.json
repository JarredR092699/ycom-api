  "long_description": "Paasa is the global investing platform for aspiring HNIs in emerging markets.\r\n\r\nHNIs in countries like India want to diversify their wealth internationally. Saving their wealth in a depreciating currency puts them at risk in a global context. However, most customers still hesitate due to lack of guidance on capital controls, tax laws that change every year, and slow outflows from local banks.\r\n\r\nPaasa streamlines this - thus empowering HNIs to save for their child's education, spend overseas confidently, and build generational wealth in a stable currency.\r\n",
