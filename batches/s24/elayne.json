  "long_description": "Elayne empowers families to build generational wealth by automating estate planning and settlements on a single, unified platform. As the AI Executor, we manage the entire estate transfer process, facilitating $3 trillion in wealth transfers annually, with a ~3% take rate.\r\n\r\nAdria experienced this challenge firsthand after her mom passed away, leaving her to settle the estate while balancing her career. The process is currently entirely manual and takes an average of 400 hours over 18 months. Adria eventually burned out and resigned, which is when she realized that bereavement costs businesses $100 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and attrition.\r\n\r\nBy addressing this problem through businesses, Elayne generates recurring revenue in an industry traditionally reliant on 1x transactions, while maintaining a lasting presence in the end userâ€™s life. We directly alleviate the 43% increase in attrition following the death of a family member, while reducing overall costs for grieving families, democratizing estate support, and saving users hundreds of hours in financial, legal, and administrative tasks per loss.",
