  "long_description": "Over 75% of today’s workforce will need to plan for or manage a family member’s death in the next decade, a process that takes over 400 hours across 18 months. This administrative burden causes a $100 billion annual drag on US companies due to lost productivity, absenteeism, and attrition.\r\n\r\nOur platform leverages GenAI and post-pandemic policy changes to automate financial, legal, and administrative tasks. Our AI assistant auto-populates modules based on uploaded materials, identifies gaps in the estate plan, and provides straightforward recommendations.\r\n\r\nBy approaching this problem as an employee benefit, Elayne addresses the 44% increase in attrition and 76% drop in productivity that follows a family member’s death.",
