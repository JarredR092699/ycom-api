  "long_description": "Willow is an AI-powered revenue cycle management software. Starting with the intake and coding process for skilled nursing facilities, we maximize reimbursement by converting complex clinical paperwork into accurate diagnoses and ICD codes.\r\n \r\nWe built Willow after seeing how nursing homes struggle with revenue cycle challenges that result in lost revenue and claim denials. Traditional processes are outdated and prone to errors, with no solution tailored to the complexities of long-term care. Our AI-driven platform addresses this gap, simplifying operations and reducing costly mistakes so staff can focus on delivering quality patient care.\r\n \r\nOver $490 billion is spent annually on long-term care in the US. With the growing demand and increasing complexity of insurance billing, Willow ensures long-term care providers capture the full value of their services. ",
