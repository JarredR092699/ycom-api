  "long_description": "We are engineering photosynthesizing bacteria and cascading their enzymatic outputs for low-cost, scalable, and carbon-negative polymer manufacturing. We want to take in tons of CO2 to help reverse climate change while also working to decarbonize supply chains, so carbon capture becomes redundant in the first place.\r\n\r\nWe have engineered the fastest photosynthesizing organism in the world with CRISPR and use generative models to design our enzymatic cascades. We are stating with starch as the quintessential polymer but will expand to other verticals soon.",
