  "long_description": "Proxis is the first dedicated platform for LLM distillation and serving, unlocking production ready models at 1/10th the cost.\r\n\r\nFine-tuning frontier models like GPT-4 on proprietary data is expensive, and locks customers into one external closed source model provider. \r\n\r\nTo solve this, enterprise AI teams can use Proxis to distill state-of-the-art Llama 405b into an efficient model tuned on their own data, which is 5x faster and 10x cheaper than closed source alternatives.",
