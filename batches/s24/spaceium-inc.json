  "long_description": "Spaceium builds service hubs in space that refuel and repair spacecraft. Imagine driving from New York to California, carrying all the fuel you'll need for the entire trip, with no service stations along the way. That's how space flight works today.\r\n\r\nOur service hubs efficiently store and transfer both cryogenic (extremely cold) and non-cryogenic fuels with zero loss during storage and transfer. And they can transfer fuel seamlessly to any spacecraft design using our proprietary modular robotic arm.\r\n\r\nOur customers include launch vehicles, orbital transfer vehicles, moon landers, and spacecraft that benefit from increased payload capacity and extended travel capabilities. Our long term vision is to build service hubs along the space superhighway to connect Earth to Moon and Mars and help humanity to become multi planetary species\r\n",
