We’ve released our first module - AI accounting and supply chain management - to 7 customers in the last 6 weeks. We’ve booked $8.3k in MRR and just signed a pilot with a $200M apparel company. \r\n\r\nWe offer automated bookkeeping, supply chain management, inventory costs, and contribution margin analysis.  Our system seamlessly integrates with Quickbooks and ERPs, eliminating manual data entry and minimizing errors.\r\n\r\nUsers can interact with Superunit via Slack or email, avoiding the need to learn new software.\r\n\r\n(https://www.loom.com/share/1425f6802d774e1aa00a8ac4b64782ff)\r\n",
