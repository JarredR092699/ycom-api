  "long_description": "Gauge is solving the monolith/microservices dilemma. Weâ€™re helping enterprises break large codebases into small pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe first met as roommates in college, and in the decade since we've both worked exclusively at startups, including multiple founding engineering roles. We ran into this problem time and time again as our startups began to scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're now working with a wide range of companies, including a number of multi-billion $ enterprises. Our open source tooling also has ~1k stars on GitHub, over 400k downloads, and is in use by Nvidia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the short term, Gauge is building tools to modularize the monolith. Long term, Gauge is building a way to deploy a single codebase as a set of independent services, giving you the scalability of microservices alongside the simplicity of monolithic development.\r\n",
