  "long_description": "Gauge is building open source Python tools that help solve the microservices/monolith dilemma. Weâ€™re doing this by enabling teams to build and scale a modular monolith. Our first tool is called Tach, and it lets you create module boundaries automatically. Tach is currently live in production with a number of companies, has over 100k downloads, and over 500 stars on GitHub. Check it out here! https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach\r\n\r\nCaelean and Evan first met as roommates in college, and in the decade since they've both worked exclusively at startups, including multiple founding engineering roles. They both ran into this problem time and time again as their startups began to scale.\r\n\r\nIn the short term, Gauge is building tools to help you scale a modular monolith. Long term, Gauge is building a way to deploy a single codebase as a set of independent services, giving you the scalability of microservices with the simplicity of a monolith.\r\n",
