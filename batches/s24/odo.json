  "long_description": "State and local governments buy $1.5TN worth of products and services from companies every year, ranging from consulting, constructions, to yes, cream cheese and bagels. However, the process of winning government contracts today is extremely fragmented, non-standardized, and time consuming. Companies can’t easily find relevant contracts, spend 40-80 hours drafting proposals, and don’t know why they won or lost a contract.\r\n\r\nOdo is the first AI-powered platform to help companies win state and local government contracts. Odo can find relevant contracts, draft proposals, and analyze wins and losses through public records sourcing. Our customers have saved up to 80% of time and doubled their government sales pipeline.\r\n\r\nWith Odo, you can win more government contracts at a fraction of the cost.",
