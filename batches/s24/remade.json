  "long_description": "Remade uses AI to scale hyper-personalized video generation for marketplaces. Our first customer, Scentbird, a midmarket fragrance marketplace uses Remade to create engaging TikTok ad hooks. We are a team of 4 Cambridge AI hackers with publications in CVPR, the largest Computer Vision conference, and the Lancet Journal, the most respected medical journal globally. Our ARR grew 83% last week from 18k to 33k with an additional 17k pilot revenue with Rappi and eFood, which will take us to a 650k contracted ARR by EoQ. We are building out a research-arm to develop proprietary tech, fusing recommendation algorithms with video models to deliver hyper-personalised videos that increase conversion.",
