  "long_description": "Remade uses AI to create studio-quality product photoshoots from a smartphone.\r\n\r\nTraditional photography is labour-intensive, slow, and expensive. Enterprises spend thousands on it, while smaller businesses often can't afford it. Remade reduces the cost of professional images by 100x and cuts delivery time from weeks to 15 minutes. Using AI and social media data, we personalize content creation and optimize product ads. Our mission is to streamline visual content generation across multiple industries, making it faster and more accessible for businesses.",
