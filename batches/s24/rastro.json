  "long_description": "Rastro is a personal shopper for home decor. Our AI agents find you products from any retailer on the internet: we aim to build Perplexity for shopping. Built by ex-Shopify AI engineers, we're doing $25k monthly GMV with 15% margins.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecorating your home can cost tens of thousands for an interior designer, or involve hours of scrolling retailer sites. Tell Rastro about your vision, and send our agents to source for you. Receive dozens of products in minutes. Our agents understand your taste, and their picks convert 10 times better than classic e-commerce search. \r\n\r\nUnder the hood, we're building general purpose agents capable of sourcing products matching your taste and constraints from any retailer on the internet. Our algorithms consider images and descriptions, as well as product style, materials, brand and location. ",
