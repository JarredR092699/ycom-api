  "long_description": "BeeBettor is a platform for researching, analyzing, and selling sports betting data. On top of their day job, sports bettors spend hours every day picking the bets they want to make, often sharing that for free with their followers. They want to be compensated for their work, but existing solutions are fragmented. There is no easy way to create and distribute content to paying subscribers. BeeBettor combines our top-of-the-line research tool with built-in distribution, automating as much as possible for our creators.",
