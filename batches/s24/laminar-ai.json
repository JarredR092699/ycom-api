  "long_description": "Laminar is a platform that enables AI developers to rapidly iterate on LLM applications to ensure reliability. We do this by providing:\r\n\r\n- a GUI to build LLM applications as dynamic graphs with seamless local code interfacing. These graph pipelines can be directly hosted on our infrastructure and exposed as scalable API endpoints.\r\n- an open-source package to generate abstraction-free code from these graphs directly into developers' codebases.\r\n- a state-of-the art evaluation platform that lets users build fast and custom evaluators without managing evaluation infrastructure themselves.\r\n- a data management infrastructure with built-in support for vector search over datasets and files. Data can be easily ingested into LLMs and LLMs can write to the datasets directly, creating a self-improving data flywheel.\r\n- a low latency logging and observability infrastructure.\r\n\r\nLaminar combines orchestration, evaluations, data, and observability in a single platform to empower AI developers to ship reliable LLM applications 10x faster.",
