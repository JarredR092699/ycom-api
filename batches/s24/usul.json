  "long_description": "Usul helps companies win defense contracts with AI. Recent conflicts have forced the DoD to demand the next-generation of military technology. So we built software for US companies and our allies to collaborate and sell to the government. \r\n\r\nIn the past 3 weeks, we’ve signed 6 customers at $104k ARR and 12 pilots worth another $212k ARR when they convert. This includes the fastest-growing defense company and a big 3 consulting firm.\r\n\r\nThere are 1M companies who sell to the DoD, and we charge $24k on average. This is a $24B market that's growing quickly due to recent geopolitics.\r\n\r\nWe’re 4 Stanford engineers from Palantir, NASA, & Reliable Robotics where we experienced this problem first hand and learned how to win this market.
