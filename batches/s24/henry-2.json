  "long_description": "Henry is an AI copilot for commercial real estate (CRE) brokers that seamlessly integrates a brokerage’s internal data set with external sources to generate custom presentations and financial modeling for deals. Our mission is to help CRE brokers close more deals faster, earning more while doing less repetitive work. We’re initially focusing on enabling brokers to generate deal decks in seconds—a task that typically consumes 20+ hours a week across multiple departments within a brokerage.\r\n\r\nThe long term vision is to take all of these brokerages' unstructured data and build the most powerful CRE database on the planet. Because brokers are involved at the heart of every CRE transaction, we are capturing this transaction data at the source, where no data company in the industry can access. The more brokerages leveraging Henry on transactions, the more unstructured data Henry can ingest. The better the data Henry stores, the better it gets at providing accurate CRE insights and completing brokers' tasks. Henry will have definitively more accurate, real time data, pulled from both integrations to brokerages internal data (i.e emails and salesforce) and from data emitted by the platform itself (i.e sales comps, unit prices etc.). The plan is to start with building the best in class workflow solution and end up with an impenetrable data moat.",
