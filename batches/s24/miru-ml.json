  "long_description": "Miru automates deploying and managing software for robots and IoT devices. We provide engineers with the infrastructure to deploy updates over-the-air to a fleet of devices by simply pushing new changes to GitHub.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting at their freshman dorm at the University of Texas at Austin, Armel, Vedant, and Ben spent their time in college building an AI-video dev tool. They are passionate about a future where robots can free humans from doing the dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks that dominate billions of peopleâ€™s lives. They founded Miru to provide the infrastructure to accelerate this transition.",
