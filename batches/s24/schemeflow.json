  "long_description": "- Getting housing and infrastructure built takes FAR TOO LONG in the developed world today. YEARS are taken up in approvals and technical work before work on site can begin. \r\n- SchemeFlow uses generative AI to draft the technical reports required for construction projects.\r\n- Environmental impact assessments, traffic impact studies, acoustics, geotechnical, flood risk, heritage reports. The list goes on... Our technology lets technical professionals draft these reports in minutes rather than months.\r\n- We HAVE to tackle this problem to restore prosperity and dynamism to our towns and cities. IT'S TIME TO BUILD AGAIN.",
