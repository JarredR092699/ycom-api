  "long_description": "DreamRP lets creators earn money by turning their characters into chatbots. For example, George R.R. Martin could charge fans to chat with a Jon Snow bot.\r\n\r\nAI roleplaying is ravenously popular, but no existing platform focuses on the most impactful component of the experience: the creators who make the characters. With a more ethical implementation of AI and the right creation and monetization features, DreamRP has unlocked AI roleplaying for the most talented and successful creators.",
