  "long_description": "Pax uses AI to automate import tax refunds (aka duty drawback) for retailers and manufacturers. We launched 4 weeks ago and have ~$200K in contracts.\r\n\r\nEach year, 80% of eligible refunds—equivalent to $11B—go unclaimed. Pax is the first AI-powered broker helping brands under $50M reclaim 3-5% of their revenue. Our algorithms generate 15% more refunds than the industry leader and reduce processing time by 99% with AI.\r\n\r\nPax was founded by Penny, an MIT PhD who encountered the duty drawback problem firsthand at Flexport, and Chris, a second-time founder and engineer with experience at Amazon, Brex, and TikTok.",
