  "long_description": "Pax is an AI powered platform that streamlines import tax rebates for global trade companies, from retailers to manufacturers. We help file refunds in clicks, not months.\r\n\r\nPreviously, companies had to rely on customs brokerage firms due to the complex, manual nature of the process. These firms often enforce a minimum threshold of $100K, rejecting SMBs. Paxâ€™s technology democratizes this process, enabling companies of all sizes to file drawback claims.\r\n\r\nApproximately 80% of duties, amounting to about $10 billion annually, go unclaimed. Pax enables companies of all sizes to recover money that is rightfully theirs, ensuring they never leave free money on the table.\r\n\r\nBy automating and simplifying the import tax recovery process, Pax is revolutionizing how global trade companies manage their finance and customs compliance.",
