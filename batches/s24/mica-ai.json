  "long_description": "Mica automates a company’s entire sales follow-up process. Mica’s AI agents analyze sales calls and other communication, figure out what the prospect cared about the most, build tailored collateral that’s sent to them post-call, and continuously follow up with relevant information until a deal is closed. \r\n\r\nMica provides all the information needed to make a purchasing decision — in one centralized location.\r\n\r\nWith 3M B2B companies in the US alone, and our price of $100/month/seat, this is a 11B market opportunity in just the United States\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile working with with sales teams at their previous jobs, the founders noticed that the best sales reps weren’t just good at selling—they were also elite content creators - crafting tailored collateral like decks, 1-pagers, demos and more that their champions used to advocate for them within their companies. \r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, crafting good collateral took over 30 minutes per call. With multiple calls a day, they could only prioritize some of their clients. With Mica, we cut the follow-up creation time from 30 minutes to under 1 minute, allowing them to serve all their clients, leading to more closed deals and more revenue.\r\n",
