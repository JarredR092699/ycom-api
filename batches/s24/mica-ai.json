  "long_description": "Mica helps B2B SaaS sales teams close more deals by turning sales calls into personalized deal summary pages to share with prospects.\r\n\r\nMica ingests your sales calls and automatically creates a comprehensive landing page after each call. This page includes everything your prospect needs to make a decision—pain points, solutions, proven results, pricing, and next steps—all in one place.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that decision-makers, regardless of whether they were on the original call, have access to the most relevant information in one centralized location.\r\n\r\nBefore Mica, the founders often found themselves on sales calls with vendors, where they would learn about various product features and benefits. After the call, they would need to convey this information to other decision-makers on their team who weren't on the call. However, they often struggled to communicate the value propositions as effectively as the sales rep. This miscommunication frequently led to delays or even halted deals, costing sellers anywhere from $10k to $500k+ per deal. This led the founders to create Mica.\r\n\r\nSales reps needed a way to present the highlights of the call so that everyone in the prospect's organization could get the same experience of being on the original call, without having to sit through the entire conversation. \r\n\r\nBy using Mica, sales teams have seen significant increases in conversion rates, faster sales cycles, and improved alignment among stakeholders. Mica ensures that everyone involved in the decision-making process is fully informed and engaged, ultimately leading to more closed deals.\r\n",
