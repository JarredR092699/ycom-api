With just a few clicks, Lumenary's quality platform can accurately and in real time abstract unstructured charts into the precise forms necessary for clinical registry submissions, infection control documentation, safety incident reporting, and population health analysis, saving millions in labor costs and overhead. Lumenary was founded by four best friends who met at Dartmouth College, with engineering expertise from Jane Street Capital, IMC Trading, Palantir Technologies, and Flatiron Health. They've published high impact machine learning research in venues like NeurIPS, in addition to deploying enterprise software managing billions of dollars and petabytes of data. Lumenary is co-developing its quality platform with a leading academic medical center.",
