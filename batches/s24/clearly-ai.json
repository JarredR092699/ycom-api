  "long_description": "Clearly AI automates AppSec reviews and privacy assessments to provide a first line of defense, so that security and privacy engineers can focus on the most critical applications for their enterprise.\r\n\r\nSecurity and privacy teams are severely understaffed. Teams  only review a fraction of features released, putting corporations at risk. At Amazon and Moveworks, we felt this pain during hundreds of security and privacy reviews.\r\n\r\nWith Clearly AI, teams can review all features and applications for best practices and compliance, triage which applications need deep security analysis, and accelerate all necessary reviews.\r\n\r\nClearly AI is built by security engineers for security engineers.",
