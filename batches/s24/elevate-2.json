  "long_description": "We make it easy for AI agents to buy anything on the internet. For example, if a user asked an AI agent to buy a book on an e-commerce site, we handle the purchase via our Purchasing API. \r\n\r\nAI agents are poised to elevate the way we shop, but they aren’t reliably making purchases today. We’re changing that by bringing uniformity to non-uniform checkout flows across the internet.\r\n\r\nOur expertise is at the intersection of payments and e-commerce. Angelica was a staff engineer at Stripe, driving API evolution, design, and governance across payments products. Scott was a senior investor at Sycamore Partners, investing in and partnering with leading consumer companies. \r\n\r\nOur solution will enable AI agents to make payments of every kind, including e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, eBay), consumer services (e.g., Uber, DoorDash), and B2B (e.g., supplier payment). In the US e-commerce market alone, there are 10B transactions every year, representing a significant opportunity for us. We have already onboarded multiple AI agent customers who have thousands of monthly users and have begun integrating them to power their e-commerce purchases. ",
