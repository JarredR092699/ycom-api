  "long_description": "We use AI to streamline data integrations for mergers & acquisitions (M&A), with a focus on private equity (PE)-backed roll-ups. We take messy data (e.g., customer, financial, operational) that sits across disparate systems in different formats and use LLMs to unify, clean, and enrich it. Our approach expedites speed to value capture post-acquisition without distracting management teams or requiring expensive data engineering resources. \r\n\r\nOur experience is at the intersection of finance x tech. With an increasingly competitive M&A marketplace driven by $0.5T+ of dry powder, clean, usable data is a massive competitive advantage throughout the investment cycle – in diligence, to make informed investment decisions; in value creation, to execute the strategic plan quickly and confidently; and in exit, where better data leads to better outcomes.  We’re on a mission to make AI useful for any company with messy data. ",
