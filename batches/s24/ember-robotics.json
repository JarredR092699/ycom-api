  "long_description": "Ember builds software to monitor and resolve camera issues so robotics companies can reduce vision failures from the source. Understanding when and how cameras fail in a maze of software, hardware and firmware is incredibly time consuming. Our tools analyze real-time camera data, system logs, and field reports to deliver actionable insights on camera performance. From new hardware integration to deployments at scale, we help robotics companies build great robots instead of dealing with hardware reliability headaches.",
