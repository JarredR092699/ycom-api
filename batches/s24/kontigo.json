  "long_description": "TL;DR; We're connecting all Latinos across the U.S. and Latin America through a single banking app that is global, instant, and stable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problem:\r\n\r\n- The U.S. is home to 65 million Latinos, 25% of whom are underbanked. Despite this, they represent the fastest-growing population in the country, contributing to 91% of the population growth over the last four years.\r\n- Each year, Latinos in the U.S. send over $170 billion to Latin America, often incurring fees as high as 15%.\r\n- Once the money reaches Latin America, recipients incur additional fees of up to 10% to convert and cash out.\r\n- Latin America has a population of 670 million, with 20% of households relying on remittances for their income.\r\n- Latin America is a region made up of 33 countries, yet it has seen 39 different currencies fail over time, making it one of the most economically unstable areas in the world. It also has some of the highest rates of inflation and currency devaluation.\r\n\r\nKontigo is like Venmo, but on-USDC. Like Zelle, but for instant & free cross-border payments. Like Nubank, but no inflationary currencies. No intermediaries. \r\n\r\n A USDC global wallet & BTC savings account. \r\n\r\nCombined with an AI-personalized financial advisor on WhatsApp for your daily needs. \r\n- Execute USDC transactions.\r\n- Build-Credit.\r\n- Plan your BTC retirement.\r\n\r\nFounding team is Ex-Venmo, Nubank, Rappi, MercadoLibre, UalÃ¡, Platzi, Yuno. \r\n\r\nMade for real-life use case. No crypto BS. ",
