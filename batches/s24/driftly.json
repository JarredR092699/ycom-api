  "long_description": "Driftly automates scheduling for home health agencies, eliminating 1-2 hours of driving per clinician per day.\r\n\r\nHome health clinicians spend about 1/3 of their time driving. With the 85+ population projected to double in the next decade, home health providers are struggling to meet growing demand, and they're already being forced to turn away 75% of referred patients. Driftly helps solve this by making clinicians 10-15% more productive, allowing home health agencies to grow their patient census (and their revenue) without hiring more clinicians.",
