  "long_description": "Today, 80% of spending on home healthcare is unrelated to providing care, and most of these tasks can be automated with LLMs. Home health agencies use specialized home health EHRs to manage all aspects of their business--these systems are slow-moving and don't interoperate with third party tools. We're building a new EHR from the ground up.\r\n\r\nOur first feature is clinician scheduling, which is the biggest pain point for most agencies today. Our software cuts clinician travel time in half, eliminating 10% of total costs and more than doubling profitability.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
