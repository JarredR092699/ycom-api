Our AI-powered warranty platform generates incremental revenue and boosts customer loyalty at zero cost to the merchant.\r\n\r\nWe earn a margin on each policy sold. Currently, we’re live with 60 merchants generating $22K in monthly revenue. We’ve booked an additional $50K of monthly revenue in signed contracts. \r\n\r\nSanket led engineering at PolicyBazar, an insurance tech company that IPOed and is valued at over $8B. Manish worked at Amazon and has built $100M ARR products, handling over 180B requests per day.\r\n\r\nUntil now, finding the right policy for any product and pricing it at the right price wasn’t possible at scale. We automated this process using LLM and have unlocked a $50B+ opportunity. Each month, over 5 million consumers view SureBright warranty offers.",
