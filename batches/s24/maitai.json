  "long_description": "Implementing AI is complex and time-consuming. Teams today spend too much of their time juggling prompt engineering, RAG, guardrails, fallbacks, and model selection. Though this is necessary for a production-ready application, it can be a massive distraction from building and expanding the core product, not to mention a sizable investment. \r\n\r\nMaitai integrates seamlessly between the application and model providers to handle the heavy lifting behind the scenes. The result? Higher quality, reliable model output with passive incremental improvement - without any new code. We leverage our robust real-time evaluation engine to build a deep understanding of the customer's application, as well as the capabilities of all major models, in order to deliver consistent, dependable results. This abstraction layer is essential as the AI landscape evolves and new models emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we offer:\r\n- Real-time fault detection with autocorrection to prevent any detrimental responses\r\n- Tailored models that improve over time, specific to your application\r\n- Enterprise-grade resiliency with smart routing and fallbacks for consistent request fulfillment\r\n- Actionable alerts via Slack/PagerDuty to keep your team informed\r\n- Full observability through our comprehensive customer dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\nSolve your LLM issues in 2 minutes with Maitai.",
