  "long_description": "Online meetings are one of the main deliverables for financial advisors, but keeping track of insights, notes, and tasks during these meetings is challenging for advisors as they have to remain engaged in the call while writing down details.\r\n\r\nThyme solves this using transcription, summarization, document parsing, and seamless synchronization with the rest of the advisor stack, including Wealthbox and Redtail. \r\n\r\nOur users save hours each week and have much better notes that raise the quality of their client relationships.",
