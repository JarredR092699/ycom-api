  "long_description": "Hestus is AI-powered CAD software that speeds up hardware development. While engineers are typically quick at coming up with initial design concepts, they are bogged down getting from idea to the final design due to countless tedious and repetitive tasks. We are building CAD software that automates these mundane tasks and speeds up the design execution process, while letting engineers spend more time on the creative part of the design process.\r\n",
