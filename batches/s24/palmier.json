  "long_description": "Developers spend only about 30% of their time actually building new features, with the rest of their day taken up by tedious but necessary tasks like understanding code, fixing bugs, and reviewing other people's code. And this only gets worse as the codebase gets larger. Palmier tackles this problem with an AI that truly understands a developer’s codebase, taking on the time-consuming tasks that often hinder their productivity. By helping developers quickly grasp complex code, review their work, and spot errors, Palmier frees up their time to focus more on designing and creating. With Palmier, developers can work faster and with greater confidence, boosting productivity and getting back to what they love—building great software.",
