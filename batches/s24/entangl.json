  "long_description": "As aerospace engineers, we've experienced firsthand the painful reality of cross-team design reviews. Teams grind for weeks to prepare for these meetings, yet costly errors still slip through to manufacturing or even operation (think doors blowing off planes).\r\n\r\nThe issue? Engineers work in silos, unaware of how their decisions impact the broader system. Changing the O-ring material might unexpectedly impact the seal integrity at low temperatures when building a space shuttle booster rocket (see NASA Space Shuttle Disaster).\r\n\r\nOur platform identifies design problems autonomously across engineering projects. It then suggests targeted solutions to the right engineers and delivers daily insights and reviews, preventing expensive problems early on (poor engineering cost Boeing $100B+).  This saves each engineer 2 months of work every year and makes engineering safer.\r\n",
