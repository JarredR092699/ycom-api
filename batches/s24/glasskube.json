Kubernetes is highly fragmented, making it nearly impossible to deploy applications across multiple environments with current tooling. We help software companies sell to enterprises and deploy to private infrastructure, different cloud environments, and on-premises.\r\n\r\nThe founders have been best friends for over 15 years, lived together in college, and even had a startup together. Philip was the CTO of a European Kubernetes-based company that was acquired in 2022.",
