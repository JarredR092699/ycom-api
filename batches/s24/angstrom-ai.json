  "long_description": "We build GenAI-based molecular simulations to substitute wet lab experiments in the drug development pipeline. Our Biotech/Pharma clients can verify the efficacy and safety of new drug candidates using our computer simulations, which match the accuracy of wet lab experiments but are faster.\r\n\r\nOur AI models do not require training data, the limiting factor in ML for bio. They learn directly from the equations of physics. Furthermore, our simulations obey the laws of physics, avoiding the hallucinations seen in other GenAI technologies (e.g., generating an image of a person with six fingers.)\r\n\r\nSince joining YC, Angstrom AI has developed the first physically accurate AI-based simulation of multiple molecules interacting. We have published the first molecule water solubility results with accuracy within the error range of wet lab experiments.",
