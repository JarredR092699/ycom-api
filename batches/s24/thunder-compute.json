  "long_description": "GPUs are in extremely high demand for AI development. A single GPU server can cost up to $300K. Despite this, GPUs in data centers are only utilized an average of 15-20% of the time. Thunder Compute is building technology to increase GPU utilization from 15-20% to 90%+, meaning that each GPU can be shared by 5x as many developers as in data centers today. Our technology achieves this efficiency gain by allowing all of the servers in a data center to share a single pool of network-attached GPUs rather than physically attaching a GPU to each server.
