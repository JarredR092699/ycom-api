  "long_description": "Zimi is a cross-border commerce partner dedicated to simplifying global expansion for international brands. We empower businesses to thrive in new markets by optimizing cross-border logistics, offering seamless local fulfillment, and automating secure international paymentsâ€”all in one streamlined platform. \r\n\r\nCross-border e-commerce is a $2 trillion opportunity by 2030, however, cross-border merchants face major challenges like high shipping costs, lengthy delivery times, and complex logistics. This is particular true for merchants in emerging markets. With Zimi, merchants reach their international buyers in 1-2 days instead of weeks and for a fraction of the price. Our aim is to make selling internationally as easy as selling locally - starting with merchants selling into the U.S. market. ",
