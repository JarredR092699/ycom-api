  "long_description": "Zimi is a tech-enabled fulfillment provider that is bringing Amazon Prime-like delivery to exporters in emerging markets. We help merchants deliver to their international buyers in 2 days instead of 2 weeks, and at a fraction of the typical shipping cost (80% cheaper on average). \r\n\r\nCross-border e-commerce is a $2 trillion opportunity by 2030, with 64% of that coming from emerging markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. However, merchants in these regions face major challenges like high shipping costs, lengthy delivery times, and complex logistics. Zimi solves these problems by localizing inventory, handling customs clearance and last-mile delivery, and streamlining the returns process. Our aim is to make selling internationally as easy as selling locally. ",
