  "long_description": "Patched is an open-source framework to automate code reviews, docs, and patches with AI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe empower developers to build and deploy AI-assisted workflows that can autonomously complete repetitive, mundane tasks like documentation, code reviews, and security patching.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatched is the preferred option for privacy-conscious enterprises and engineer that want to leverage the best AI models for their development workflows without compromising security, control, or compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What makes Patched different?**\r\n- Autonomous Automation: Unlike copilots that assist during active development, Patched runs in the background, managing tasks autonomously.\r\n- Code-Native Workflows: Flows can be built using visual editors or Python code.\r\n- Open-Source Flexibility: Allows running patchflows locally and integrating with preferred LLM API endpoints for enhanced privacy.\r\n- Control & Precision: Get full control over your workflows, overcoming limitations of non-deterministic agentic behaviors.",
