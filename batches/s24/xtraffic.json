  "long_description": "XTraffic is at the intersection of advancements in sensor technology and affordability. Where it would previously cost a city up to $100,000 per intersection to create intelligent traffic lights, we can accomplish the same for pennies on the dollar. This means entire cities can affordably upgrade their infrastructure - and some already are. We are live in multiple cities, with both ongoing and successful pilots, corridors of multiple intersections, and soon to be entire cities. Our customers enjoy less traffic, better safety, and data on which to build their future.",
