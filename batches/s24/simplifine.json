  "long_description": "Research work is hell. It is very silo'ed, and the workflow is clunky - this is because researchers create their own pipelines with tools (for all things literature search, review, note-taking, writing, editing, data analysis, and so on) that are not designed for researchers.\r\n\r\nSimplifine is designed for researchers, by researchers. We supercharge all those research tasks with specialised LLMs so researchers do not need to use dozens of badly integrated tools ever again. We are the only app researchers will need.",
