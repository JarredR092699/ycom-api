  "long_description": "Time to build the database for a clinical trial is 68 days on average. The cost of a day lost in a clinical trial is 50k-300k (depending on phase). Pharma and biotech companies spend ~25% of their clinical trial budget ($1-5 million) on source data verification, checking to make sure data is accurate.\r\n\r\nWe use AI to process information from a study's protocol and data management plan, automating much of the form and database building and data checking processes. This can cut study build times in half and prevent further expensive delays due to uncaught data errors. ",
