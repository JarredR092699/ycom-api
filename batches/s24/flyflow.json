  "long_description": "\"Flyflow is miles better than Twilio IVR\"  - Digital Marketing Customer\r\n\r\nFlyflow brings your brand to life with human-like AI support agents. When human agents are not available or affordable, our customers use Flylow-powered voice support to answer their customersâ€™ questions. We provide AI trained on company-specific knowledge, triggers to escalate to human-agents, automatic actions (like email and scheduling), and best-in-class conversation quality. \r\n\r\nHow are we different?\r\n(1) Incredibly easy to set up: get up and running in under an hour with a phone number your customers can call right away.\r\n(2) Configurable: get access to all the knobs and dials so that you can create an experience that feels natural to your customers\r\n(3) Best-in-class conversation quality: end-pointing, interruption handling, and latency reduction all built in-house\r\n(4) Easy transition from IVR and call-center support: purpose-built for use cases like customer support and lead qualification",
