  "long_description": "Every Origami Agent works like a dedicated human sales rep, analyzing social comments, press releases, and product pages to find your perfect leads. \r\n\r\nNow, use millions of Origami Agents working 24/7 to bring you the top 1% of buyers for your solution every day.\r\n‎ \r\nPreviously, Finn built custom outbound solutions for over 20 startups, while Kenson was the CTO at an enterprise sales startup. We found ourselves building this tool for our customers over and over again, and that it worked 10x better than all other outbound strategies.\r\n‎ \r\n In our first 20 days, we’ve gone from $0 to over $100k ARR. \r\n\r\nThere’s enough information on the internet to know exactly which prospects are primed to buy, and most sales teams still haven’t realized this yet.",
