  "long_description": "Every Origami Agent works like a dedicated human sales rep, analyzing websites, press releases, and product pages to bring you the top 1% of your customers every day.\r\n\r\nUse millions of Origami Agents to make sense of the other 99% of data that's not in structured databases.\r\n‎ \r\nPreviously, Finn built custom outbound solutions for over 20 startups, while Kenson was the CTO at an enterprise sales startup. We found ourselves building this tool for our customers over and over again, and that it worked 10x better than all other outbound strategies.\r\n‎ \r\nThere’s enough information on the internet to know exactly who your perfect customers are, and most sales teams still haven’t realized this yet.",
