  "long_description": "Curo helps electric fleets park and charge their vehicles anywhere with the worldâ€™s largest private network of underutilized EV charging sites. We increase revenue by 5x for EV charger owners and enable instant fleet electrification at a fraction of the cost. \r\n\r\nOwners of EV chargers get <10% utilization after paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to install, and distributed fleets are rapidly trying to electrify yet charging is a huge bottleneck. Curo is a Virtual Depot platform enabling fleets to long-term lease underutilized EV chargers from owners.\r\n\r\nWe're live across CA, NY and WA and have grown 100% MoM for the past 4 months. Curo is already backed by investors like Blue Bear, Not Boring, Slow and Eniac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
