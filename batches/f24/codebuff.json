  "long_description": "Chat with Codebuff to edit your codebase. It's a coding agent that can iterate and run terminal commands, just like a junior engineer -- but faster!\r\n\r\nCodebuff is going up-market from Cursor, with a $99/mo price point. It's the most powerful coding agent on the market that also happens to be the easiest to use.\r\n\r\nNote: Codebuff was renamed recently from Manicode.\r\n\r\nWhy it's cool:\r\n- **It chooses files to read automatically on each message** — unlike Cursor’s Composer feature. This saves you time and makes Codebuff respond more comprehensively.\r\n- **It takes 0 clicks** — type your instructions and Codebuff will edit your files directly. It's simple and fast. Theoretically, you can do all your development by just chatting with it!\r\n- **It has full access to your terminal** — Codebuff can run terminal commands to install packages, run tests, check for type errors, etc. Codebuff is an engineer working for you.\r\n\r\n Get it now:\r\n```\r\n> npm install -g codebuff\r\n```\r\nRun `codebuff` from your project directory. It will read and write to files in your project to produce the code you want.",
