  "long_description": "Helpcare builds AI Agents to take on coordination burden from staff and reduces time of care by autonomously identifying and outreaching patients (through phone, text, email, & mail) to schedule visits, book screenings, complete pre-post, and onboard. These agents require no integration, can navigate all tools, speak 29 languages, come with 50+ outreach scripts and have a remarkable 80% conversation-to-booking closing rate.",
