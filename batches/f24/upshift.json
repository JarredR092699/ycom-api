  "long_description": "Upshift is tooling for plugin systems and app stores. We help product companies support plugins or apps, to help them achieve outcomes like what the app stores in Salesforce and Shopify have done for those products. We believe plugin support drives more sales, better retention, and compounds value over time.\r\n\r\nUp until now, only the biggest companies have had the resources to build these app stores because it can take years and massive upfront engineering investment to ship something. We cut the time-to-production down to weeks. And this will open up previously inaccessible possibilities for mid-sized businesses and fast-growing startups.\r\n\r\nWe know how to build it. For more than five years, Adam and Thomas have worked together as eng leaders, mastering our system integration expertise from Palantir and Candid Health. Our biggest win included converting an $823 million contract vehicle for the US Army, overhauling their entire data fabric.\r\n\r\nEvery software product company who wants to enable their users to extend the platform is a potential customer. It's a clear differentiator for best-in-class software companies who want to leverage their customer base as a community working to make their product even better.",
