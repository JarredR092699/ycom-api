  "long_description": "At Tiny we’re building a compound startup like Rippling for factories. Our mission is to provide factories with a single, cohesive platform to track and manage the full lifecycle of a manufactured item across every department in their organization.\r\n\r\nTiny is a ground-up reimagination of cumbersome traditional ERP software. Factories now have an intuitive user experience that leverages live collaborative editing to get everyone working together seamlessly, with a workflow engine that assigns tasks to the right person at the right time. Furthermore, as we expand our platform, we plan to automate repetitive tasks, thereby reducing costs and unlocking valuable insights by unifying sales, procurement, and production processes—all within a single system.\r\n\r\n",
