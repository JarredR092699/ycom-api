  "long_description": "Raycaster is a private investigator for enterprise sales teams. When companies need to sell complex products, we automatically surface detailed insights about their prospects - helping them land 6-figure deals in weeks instead of months.\r\n\r\nOur customers are using Raycaster to uncover everything from lab equipment specifications to API performance metrics - insights that traditionally took months of manual research and required technical knowhow of their top 1% performers.\r\n\r\nWhat makes us unique is our ability to surface customer insights automatically and contextually, something we perfected building AI systems at Uber, Meta, and Apple that anticipated user needs before they asked.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity is massive: 200k B2B software companies are selling complex products, representing a $10B market. We're starting with enterprise sales and expanding to every function that needs intelligent research to do their best work.",
