  "long_description": "Sandra builds multilingual voice AI receptionists, specifically designed for car dealerships. It seamlessly handles customer calls—whether for appointments, service details, availability, or more—offering a natural, human-like experience 24/7. \r\n\r\nWhat sets Sandra apart is its deep integration with dealership management systems, allowing it to manage even the most complex queries. This ensures no calls or leads are missed, boosting both customer satisfaction and team efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe car dealership industry handles over 3 billion calls annually, with each call averaging 4 to 6 minutes. Traditional call centers charge between $1 and $2 per minute, depending on the complexity of the service. Thus, we estimate the total addressable market for inbound calls alone to exceed $26 billion a year. This does not even account for future opportunities in outbound calls.\r\n\r\nBefore launching Sandra, the founding team spent years working in the automotive and call center industries during their time at McKinsey. The three co-founders graduated in Data Science and AI from institutions like MIT, Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris.\r\n",
