  "long_description": "BeerMe is a community payments platform that makes sending money fun and personal. Send an old friend a couple beers ($16) on his birthday. Text your daughter a coffee ($5) to brighten her finals week. Slack your team little treats ($4 each) at the end of a long sprint. With a curated library of tokens, any moment becomes an occasion. Like all social media content, tokens can be sent via private, anonymous links on any platform where people stay connected. Transfers are instant, global, and free. Track and manage tokens, swap for other options, or cash out USDC to any crypto wallet or exchange. With BeerMe, thereâ€™s a token for every moment.",
