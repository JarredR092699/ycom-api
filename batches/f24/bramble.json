  "long_description": "Bramble is a video based property discovery platform that shows buyers the homes they actually want. Instead of using Zillow to comb through listings using only primitive filters like bedroom count and city, Bramble allows buyers to describe exactly what they're looking for and learns their preferences, just as a traditional agent would.\r\n\r\nWe got licensed as real estate agents and launched 2 months ago as a flat-rate real estate brokerage. We now have 6 accepted offers and we learned that lead generation is the biggest problem in real estate. Weâ€™ve found a much better solution to help buyers discover properties.",
