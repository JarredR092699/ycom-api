  "long_description": "Bramble is the next generation property discovery platform that shows buyers the homes they actually want. Instead of using Zillow to comb through listings using only primitive filters like bedroom count and city, Bramble allows buyers to describe exactly what they're looking for and learns their preferences, just as a traditional agent would.\r\n\r\nWe got licensed as real estate agents and launched 2 months ago as a flat-rate real estate brokerage. We now have 5 accepted offers and we learned that we can build a much better solution for property discovery. Solving property discovery is a massive opportunity to control demand, which will rocketship our growth.",
