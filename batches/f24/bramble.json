  "long_description": "Bramble is a video-first search platform for real estate, powered by AI.\r\n\r\nWe launched 2 months ago as a flat-rate real estate brokerage. We now have 6 accepted offers, and we’ve learned that lead generation is the biggest problem in real estate. We’ve found a much better solution to help buyers discover properties.\r\n\r\nBramble helps agents auto-generate beautiful video listings and helps buyers search videos of homes for what they actually care about, like natural light or a big yard.",
