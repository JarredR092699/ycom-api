  "long_description": "Praxis AI is a platform that helps manufacturing engineers shift towards a proactive maintenance mindset. This eliminates the concept of day-to-day firefighting, and results in prolonged machine life, reduced production downtimes, and improved product quality.\r\n\r\nOur simplified interface enables manufacturing teams with minimal data science knowledge to create custom complex models on the machinery they know is critical to their operations. We walk them through the process of connecting to their data, configuring and building a model, deploying a model, and finally operationalizing a model using our copilot Max.e.\r\n\r\nOnce configured, Praxis AI and Max.e directly integrate into your existing workflows. For example once a downtime prediction model has been configured for a machine, Max.e will monitor and alert when a threshold is reached and provide you with an automated root cause analysis to resolve the issue. Early results have shown that Praxis can help manufacturers reduce their unplanned production downtimes by as much as 25%. \r\n\r\nExisting solutions focus on dashboards and complex charts. We know that dashboards don't cut costs, actions do. Praxis AI takes care of the complex machine learning and enables manufacturing engineers to focus on the important task of actually running a production floor, but now empowered by data-driven AI insights.",
