  "long_description": "Innate is developing the AI brain for teachable home robots. From navigation to manipulation, interaction and planning, our robots already act entirely autonomously, and users can teach entirely new behaviors quickly.\r\nOur customers use them to do chores the way they want, starting with cleaning or serving humans.\r\n\r\nUltimately, our goal is to collect the data to build the AI for all robots of the future.",
