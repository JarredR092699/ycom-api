  "long_description": "Pearson builds AI agents to automate corporate transactions. We work with Orrick as our first design partner to automate away 40-60% of their costs of delivery, starting with M&A due diligence and financings. $3-6T dollars flow through corporate transactions a year and lawyers take home 1-3% as their cut for every transaction. In the long run, we automate corporate transactions so companies can execute these transactions themselves.",
