  "long_description": "Andoria is an AI web agent that generates in-app walkthroughs for software companies. The AI agent learns how your web application works, gathers data about your user (e.g. background & goal), and generates a custom walkthrough whenever a user needs help. When a user gets stuck, Andoria can step in, and show them exactly what to do by performing such actions. Andoria’s goal is to bring each user to “activation” from day 1. The best part: setup is only pasting a script tag into your HTML & Andoria takes it from there.",
