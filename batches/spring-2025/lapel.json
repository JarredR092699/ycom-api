  "long_description": "Lapel is building a customer operations platform that brings hospitality to the internet: one real-time view of every account + tools to power every touchpoint.\r\n\r\nWe believe online customer relationships should feel personal, not transactional. Today, most teams manage relationships through dashboards, funnels, and canned replies—great for metrics, terrible for humans.\r\n\r\nCustomers don’t see lines between Sales, Success, and Support, and your software shouldn’t either.
