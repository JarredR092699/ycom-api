  "long_description": "Daxa watches thousands of your session replays and listens to your customer feedback channels in real time â€” helping you pinpoint application issues before users churn and plan features that maximize conversion. Oftentimes, issues in your product don't make it to a support ticket until dozens of users have experienced it first. Daxa helps you combat this problem by watching users interact directly with your product and notifying you in real time via Slack or email if any issues or interesting phenomenon arise (dropoff on certain pages, features not performing as expected, etc)",
