  "long_description": "LineWise is building an AI assistant for manufacturing teams to get their line back up and running.\r\n\r\nWhen a line goes down, it can take hours to identify the problem. Engineers and technicians scramble, chasing PLC data and logs, flipping through manuals and troubleshooting guides, while production stalls.\r\n\r\nLineWise connects siloed data from PLCs, maintenance logs, and machine manuals to triage potential causes for the issue at hand. Once the issue is resolved, LineWise will remember everything for the next time and advocate preventative actions.",
