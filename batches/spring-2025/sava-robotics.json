  "long_description": "SAVA Robotics builds robot operators for sheet metal machines. From Ford Trucks to NASA Space Shuttles, sheet metal is the cornerstone of American Manufacturing.\r\n\r\nAlessio and Vedic competed in high school robotics when they met Jakob at Georgia Tech’s Robotics labs. The team experienced Vedic’s father's 12-hour shifts, operating the machines in his shop because he struggled to find workers. After visiting manufacturers across the US, they have witnessed hundreds of automation cells collect dust while shop owners scramble to find skilled labor.\r\n\r\nSAVA 01 mimics the human operator by reading machine data and manipulating unseen parts. They are starting with the CNC Press Brake and have bent production parts for YC startups. ",
