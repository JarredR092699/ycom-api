  "long_description": "Clarm is your AI-native search and agent builder on internal knowledge. Our platform is built on agentic search, connecting across 40+ enterprise integrations - CRMs, email, knowledge bases - letting you build precise, repeatable workflows.\r\n\r\nAgents often fail because their underlying context windows are mismatched, leading them to hallucinate. We built agentic search to ensure agents have all the context they need to operate fully autonomously.\r\n\r\nHere's what Clarm's paying customers use us for:\r\n\r\n- a blockchain company to provide an on-demand source of product truth in natural language, reducing alignment meetings by 90%\r\n- a financial services firm to supercharge their own product by integrating it with the target's enterprise knowledge\r\n- a top open source startup to increase engagement with their Github repo and knowledge base, turning repo visitors into contributors and customers\r\n- a healthcare firm to tailor '000s of client support questions with extremely high sensitivity, driving up engagement and turning prospects into committed customers",
