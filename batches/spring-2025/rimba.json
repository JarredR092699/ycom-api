  "long_description": "Rimba is building the AI-native operating system for industrial complianceâ€”replacing legacy giants like SAP. As industrial companies face mounting regulatory complexity, legacy ERP and compliance systems fail to keep up. \r\nWe're building a vertical platform that ingests operational data (ERP integrations, SCADA, PDFs, meter logs) and uses AI to scrub, reconcile, and generate audit-ready reports for regulations like LCFS, RFS, air permits, and prevailing-wage filings. Core value props: avoidance of multi-million-dollar fines, detection of data inconsistencies/mistakes early, and 80% cut in prep time. Integrations with legacy IT systems create one-click exports for state/federal portals and auditors. Revenue model: annual enterprise subscriptions priced per facility.",
