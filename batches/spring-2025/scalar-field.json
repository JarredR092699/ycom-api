  "long_description": "We are Scalar Field, and we are redefining the Bloomberg terminal with AI.\r\n\r\nFounded by Aman (ex-Tower, ex-Goldman) and Ramakant (ex-Microsoft), Scalar Field is already trusted by 800 traders, generating $74,000 per month in revenue.\r\n\r\nOur core hypothesis is simple: whenever an analyst, trader, or quant looks at a Bloomberg or FactSet terminal, they are—consciously or subconsciously—trying to verify a hypothesis. Current terminals make this process cumbersome, requiring users to sift through endless screens of data.\r\n\r\nAt Scalar Field, we are rebuilding the trading terminal from the ground up, enabling users to directly test their hypotheses in real time, cutting through the noise and accelerating decision-making.",
