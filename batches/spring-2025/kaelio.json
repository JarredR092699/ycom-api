  "long_description": "Kaelio is building the AI command center for healthcare organizations.\r\n\r\nWe unify clinical, operational, and financial data for hospitals, health systems, and health plans - giving them an AI agent that answers business-critical questions, flags operational risks, and recommends actions to improve clinical outcomes and financial performance.\r\n\r\nHealthcare organizations are drowning in dashboards they can't act on - or worse, flying blind because they lack the resources. We change that.",
