  "long_description": "Tropir helps AI teams debug failures in complex LLM pipelines by tracing where things broke—a prompt drift, tool error, or bad retrieval. While other platforms log inputs and outputs, Tropir traces the text flow through chained LLM calls, connecting the dots from symptoms to root cause.\r\n\r\nWe built Tropir after hand-debugging a broken agent chain for an early customer and realizing that logs alone weren’t enough. We needed a way to see why things failed, not just what failed.\r\n\r\nY Combinator backs us, and we're already used by teams building advanced agents, copilots, and RAG pipelines. As LLM-based systems grow, we believe Tropir will become essential infrastructure for every serious AI team.",
