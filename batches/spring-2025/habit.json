  "long_description": "HABIT is deploying robotic services to your neighborhood. \r\n\r\nNo need to buy a $30,000 humanoid for $300/week worth of labor. No maintenance, fleet management, or wasted time customizing robots for your use case. Our global locations will support your stores, hotels, homes, and cars with on-demand robotic services that are cheaper, better, and equipped for the job.\r\n\r\nHABIT is establishing our physical presence with the first-ever robotic car detail: orangedetail.\r\n\r\nA hand wash or detail is still the only way to clean your car without paint damage. Thatâ€™s why Americans will spend $4.2B on details in 2025. orangedetail combines the speed and convenience of a tunnel wash with the high-margin pricing ($50-$3,000+) and meticulous care of a professional auto detailer.\r\n\r\nHABIT turns general intelligence into specialized robotic expertise.\r\n\r\nOur multi-stage training framework distills knowledge from large-scale robotic foundation models into efficient student architectures and applies targeted fine-tuning with supervised methods on real-world data and reinforcement learning in simulation. The result: consumer-ready robotic experts, precisely optimized for any vertical with minimal cost, complexity, or overhead.\r\n",
