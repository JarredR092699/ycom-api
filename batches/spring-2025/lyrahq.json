  "long_description": "At Lyra, we believe B2B sales hasn’t meaningfully evolved in decades — until now. The next industrial revolution is here, and we’re building the platform to power it.\r\n\r\nModern buyers want less talk, faster decisions, and seamless experiences. Lyra helps sales teams close more deals, shorten sales cycles, and operate more efficiently — all with minimal rep involvement.\r\n\r\nWe built our own meeting software from the ground up with a real-time AI agent at its core:\r\n- Surfaces and personalizes relevant sales collateral using live conversation intelligence\r\n- Keeps deals moving by answering buyer questions when reps are offline\r\n- Replaces decks, screen shares, and long email threads with a single interactive workspace — called a Lyra. It hosts your meetings, onboarding, and integrates tools like DocuSign to give buyers a seamless path from first call to signed contract\r\n\r\nHundreds of sales calls are already hosted on Lyra, including several YC companies. We hit $100K ARR in our first two weeks.\r\n\r\nWe’re rethinking the sales stack from first call to signed contract.",
