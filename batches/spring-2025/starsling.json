  "long_description": "StarSling is building an agentic internal developer portal (IDP) that houses all your internal services, applications, APIs, documentation and has AI agents continuously improving them for you. Itâ€™s one interface that automates all the tasks that eat up a developerâ€™s time after theyâ€™ve left their code editor: deployments, performance, incidents, and bugs. Open your homepage, click on a GitHub, Linear, or Sentry issue and youâ€™ll see an Autofix button that triggers an AI agent and opens up a Pull Request with a fix, all without leaving your portal.",
