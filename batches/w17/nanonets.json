  "long_description": "NanoNets is machine learning API for developers which requires 1/10th of data and no machine learning expertise to train a model. Upload the data, wait for a few minutes and get a model you can query over their easy to use cloud API. Often companies do not have enough data to train a machine learning model on their own using state of the art algorithms as well as don't have enough data scientists to work on those problems. NanoNets solves both these problems for companies.",
