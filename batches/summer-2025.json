A productive AI agent must similarly learn how to use our computers, browsers, and software to deliver real world value. \r\n\r\nToday, browser and computer use AI is inaccurate, slow, and expensive. Model labs and enterprises who want to improve these agents are bottlenecked by two resources: \r\n\r\n1) High quality datasets for benchmarking and evaluations\r\n2) Realistic sandbox environments for safe and accurate testing/training (ex. a simulated version of Salesforce) \r\n\r\nHalluminate offers a suite of products and services to address both these issues. \r\n\r\nOur evaluation service combines proprietary datasets with high quality annotations to help our customers identify and prioritize the biggest failure modes of their computer- and browser- use AI. \r\n\r\nOur platform provides a catalog of fully managed sandboxes, empowering our customers to safely and accurately test/train at scale, resulting in improved performance. \r\n\r\nOur customers see\r\n- Improved browser- and computer-use agent performance\r\n- New and emergent frontier agent capabilities\r\n- Data driven prioritization leading to exponentially faster development speed\r\n- Increased revenue/sales via marketing from public benchmarks\r\n\r\nOur paying customers already include leading computer use model labs and the two largest browser agent companies in the space. \r\n\r\nWyatt and Jerry are friends that met their first week of school studying CS at Cornell University. Theyâ€™ve been working and studying together for 7+ years. \r\n",

    "long_description": "Perseus Defense is building a mass-manufactured Counter UAS solution for the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security. Current solutions are one-to-one, too dangerous for use on U.S. soil, and orders of magntiude more expensive than the threats they defeat. Our micro-guided missile system is man-portable, multi-domain capable, and has both forward-deployed and low-collateral defeat variants. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement. \r\n\r\nSolving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued a PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members. \r\n\r\n\"If you build this, it will be mandatory equipment for every truck, boat, and convoy in the U.S. Military. We're talking thousands of units.\" - Former DoD Procurement Officer\r\n\r\nThe White House just released Executive Order, \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" which adds billions of dollars, government support, and streamlined regulations to enable the development of our product. \r\n\r\nTraction: \r\nA UAS prototype was designed and built in one week and a prototype of the guided missile was prototyped in four days. Following the Stanford Hacking for Defense process that Perseus Defense adviser and former Army Ranger Dr. Jeff Decker wrote the book on, Jason and Steve used 60 end-user interviews across the DoD and DHS to shape the product to something of critical need to both boots on the ground and DoD purchasers. Perseus has already been invited to a Phase-II in-person pitch of their solution to government end-users, signaling progress towards contract opportunities. ",
