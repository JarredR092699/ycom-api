  "long_description": "Hey ðŸ‘‹,Â weâ€™re Haz and Wyatt, the founders of Pally, and weâ€™re building at the intersection of AI and Human Relationships. \r\n\r\nWe believe that while AI will automate a lot of low-level tasks, that this will dramatically increase the value of human connection at the highest level.\r\n\r\nIn a world full of â€˜AI SDRsâ€™, our warm connections become more important than ever. \r\n\r\nYet today, keeping track of thousands of connections across countless social platforms is impossible. We forget to respond, we miss important moments, we lose touch.  \r\n\r\nWeâ€™re building Pally to solve that. \r\n\r\nWe bring together every connection, across every platform. Our AI researches everything theyâ€™ve ever posted online, and uses its deep understanding of each person to help you achieve your goals; whether hiring, fundraising, or sales.",
