  "long_description": "Convictional exists to enable better business decisions. As companies grow, several problems can occur with decision making. Modern analytics provides decision support out of context while decisions happen without support from technology on Slack and in meetings.\r\n\r\nConvictional is solving this with AI enabled business decision making technology. Humans remain the decider while consideration is accelerated by a graph of the context in your business. We enable faster, higher quality and more satisfying decisions as you scale.",
