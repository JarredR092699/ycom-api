  "long_description": "We've fundamentally rethought how senior teams make their biggest decisions. Instead of trying to coordinate through email chains and slide decks, you get a professional-grade decision environment where the right information and the right people come together instantly.\r\n\r\nYour leaders see every major decision in motion across the enterprise. They spot emerging patterns, tap into relevant experience from past decisions, and mobilize exactly the right expertise at the right moment. No hunting for information, no voices lost in the noise, no painful reconstructions of why decisions were made.\r\n\r\nCustom workspaces spin up automatically for each decision type. Critical metrics stream in real-time. Similar past decisions surface proactively. Expert input flows through structured frameworks. Everything is instantly documented. And your team's decision-making playbook gets smarter with every call you make.",
