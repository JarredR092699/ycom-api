  "long_description": "LEAH Labs is building novel cancer cell therapies faster than biology. We use Generative Biology to design de novo proteins that give cell therapies, like CAR-T cell therapy, abilities that nature doesn't. \r\n\r\nLeveraging our precision gene editing platform, we build therapeutic modalities directly after in silico experiments in what we call our \"Bits to Therapies\" platform. We're thus able to get a bi-modal read-out of how a genbio hit works - it either helps CAR-T cells kill and proliferate, or it doesn't.\r\n\r\nWe're first using this Bits to Therapies platform to engineer novel antigen binders that could be first and/or best in class CAR-T assets.",
