  "long_description": "Buoyant Aero builds unmanned blimps that move middle-mile air freight at half the cost of a small plane. We're two MIT hardware engineers who've been friends for almost a decade, and we've built satellites and antennas at Astranis, Wafer, and OneWeb. So far, we’ve built and flown four airships - our most recent is 20 feet long and capable of speeds up to 35 miles per hour. We’ve also closed $5 million in LOIs and have two pilot programs planned. We're starting by improving air cargo in remote regions like Alaska and northern Canada, and will expand to move less-than-truckload shipments in low density parts of the world.\r\n",
