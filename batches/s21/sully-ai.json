  "long_description": "Our Mission: \"One Human, One Doctor\".\r\nWhy? Because access to a doctor is a basic human right.\r\n\r\nCustomer: \r\nHealthcare Organizations\r\n\r\nProduct: \r\nAll-in-one solution to save doctors time. \r\n\r\nProblem: \r\nDoctors spend 50% of their time on things other than patient care, and the other 50% is inefficient. \r\n\r\nSolution: \r\nAll-in-one solution for doctors that saves time from pre, post, and during-visit. \r\n\r\nOpportunity: \r\nOver 1 Billion visits patient care visits occur in the US annually, and the current average cost per visit is $300. When future visits are done by an ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) doctor at a 10x cheaper cost ($29 per visit), itâ€™s $3.9B in revenue in the US only and $25B+ globally.",
