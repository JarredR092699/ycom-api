  "long_description": "Litnerd is an online reading program that brings K-5 books to life by streaming live actors in the classroom. We blend the creator economy to traditional education, complete with ebooks and lesson plans. Litnerd will teach the 37 Million elementary school students in America how to read. \r\n\r\nToday schools spend approx. $20 Billion on reading and supplemental education programs. Yet 42% of their students still cannot read by 4th grade.\r\n\r\nLitnerd is a contracted vendor with the largest education district in America, New York City Department of Education. Our program is currently implemented as designated classroom reading time across public schools. We have been growing aggressively at 60% MoM, used by over 14,000 paying students and hit $110K in ARR in less than 5 months. ",
