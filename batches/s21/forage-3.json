  "long_description": "On Forage, community curators, called \"foragers\", create launch pages for projects they want to highlight. Launch pages combine a press release and commemorative mint into a sleek single page designed to spread like wildfire. These launches are curated on the Forage.xyz homepage, where they garner support in the form of mints. When builders create a launch page on Forage, we use the latest innovations in onchain distribution to recommend their launch to more people who will be aligned with their work.",
