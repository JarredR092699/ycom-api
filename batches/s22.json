The US government allocates ~$10 billion in job training funds every year, which is distributed to state and local governments, and eventually paid off to small brick-and-mortar job training programs, with horrible track records. \r\n\r\nIn just three months since launch, we’ve already signed $2.25 million in LOIs with three cities. Our first deal for $82.5K / month starts next week.\r\n\r\nEach year, more than 600,000 individuals are released from state and federal prisons. Another nine million are released from local jails. Yet, a year after reentry, 60% of formerly incarcerated people remain unemployed.  The success of Emerge creates a win-win-win situation: (1) jobs for reentrants, (2) workers for labor-starved industries, and (3) reduction in crime and recidivism.",

This is poised to be a best-in-class, potentially breakthrough therapy for treating iron deficiency without any GI side-effects (eg. nausea, constipation, diarrhea, etc.) typically associated with oral iron supplements, and without the risks, costs and side-effects associated with IV iron infusions. When approved, Keylika’s proprietary transdermal iron will be the world's first prescription iron patch. Iron deficiency is a hugely understated problem affecting about 1.6 billion people worldwide and more than 30 million in the US alone, translating to a $17B US market.",

    "long_description": "Founded in 2022 and based in San Diego, California, Cisterna Biologics is a technology company. It aims to solve some of the challenges currently facing the biotech industry to develop mRNA-based therapeutics – quality, quantity, longevity and cost of mRNA. As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic.\r\n\r\nCisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. For example, to remove double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), we use ribozymes - molecular scissors - to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ end. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application.",

Yo is a three-time-acquired serial entrepreneur with a McKinsey background. Misato is a previous head of R&D at Mercari.\r\nTailor is the first YC company fully based in Japan.\r\n\r\n**The Problem**\r\nIn today's business world, old ERP systems just don't keep up.\r\n\r\nTheir monolithic architecture makes it difficult for developers to tailor to the specific needs, even though that's what the enterprises want for ERP. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, legacy ERPs struggle to work well with the variety of cloud-based tools that modern businesses rely on.\r\n\r\n\r\nLegacy, monolithic systems make it very difficult to customize and hard to integrate. Every time the company wants to change something, it becomes a huge project.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding on these challenges, users of old ERP systems often face:\r\n* Hard-to-Use Interfaces: The screens and menus are old school... confusing, slowing down your work.\r\n* Wrong Set of Features: Too many unnecessary options for you and not enough of what you actually need.\r\n* Lack of Transparency: It's tough to understand what's happening behind the scenes.\r\n* High Cost: The expense of maintaining these systems eats into your budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Solution**\r\n\r\nWhy Headless?\r\n\r\n- With our headless product, the frontend is easy to customize for clients\r\n- API-first approach makes it easy to connect with other existing systems or 3rd party services\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to our clients?\r\n\r\n- Faster development\r\n- Reduced maintenance cost\r\n- Well-documented backend APIs\r\n\r\nTailor’s key capabilities:\r\n\r\n- GraphQL endpoint for flexible frontend development\r\n- Customizable data model templates to describe complex business logic of large enterprises\r\n- Customizable workflows depending on the client's specific business process\r\n- Directory service that can reflect complex organizational structure (e.g. matrix organization) to the workflow",

Derivatives trading in traditional finance has way too many gatekeepers and intermediaries. Crypto was supposed to be free of these issues and a solution to all of this, but it is itself getting more and more centralized with disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nWe at EthosX intend to pick the best of both worlds and change the way retail and institutional financial derivatives are traded world over.",

Fintechs use Sunlight to automatically make their cards top-of-wallet as soon as they're issued. \r\n\r\nMerchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. In 2021, 79% of consumers worldwide reported already having at least one payment card saved with a service or being open to doing so. \r\n\r\nIn recent years, card-issuing as-a-service has become mainstream: any company can now start their own card business in a matter of weeks. Last year, the number of new payment cards issued was at an all-time high. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new card now comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across the internet. On the other side of that equation, card issuers have no visibility or control over the card-on-file updating process, and as a result struggle to get their new users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one, leading to low conversion rates and missed revenue opportunities.\r\n\r\nUntil Sunlight.\r\n\r\nWith our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can now offer their users, at any point in their journey, a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps.\r\n\r\nThe Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more…), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number and CVV code right on the first try!",

The patent-pending ALT TEX fermentation technology creates a polyester alternative that works with the existing infrastructure to supply a sustainable, high performance and cost competitive polyester replacement to fashion brands, at scale. \r\n\r\nThe product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment:\r\n\r\n(1) Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain.\r\n\r\n(2) Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility.\r\n\r\n(3) Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways.\r\n\r\nCo-founders Myra and Avneet have worked together managing teams and projects for six years, with backgrounds in serial entrepreneurship, corporate sales at Fortune 500 companies, textile manufacturing and biochemistry. To date, ALT TEX has created their first fabric prototype that’s 70% stronger than cotton, secured $1M in LOIs and raised $2.3M.",

That's the same performance improvement you'd get from hopping in a DeLorean to 2035 and coming back with batteries from the future. But it's available today - our tech has been derisked by testing supported by the National Science Foundation, the US Air Force, and the Australian Government. \r\n\r\nOur first product is a simple fixed-wing large cargo drone that is efficient enough to remove the \"green penalty\" currently associated with electric aviation. That's a step change from today's conventional platforms.  \r\n\r\nFirst generation electric aircraft are heavy, expensive, complicated, and limited in terms of range and payload. In the entire history of aviation, that's never been a winning formula. When everyone already has access to the same batteries, materials, and motors, what really makes the difference? The answer is revolutionary aerodynamics, but in a form factor that suits today's operations and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nBeyond our own drone product line, we have partners across Aerospace helping incorporate our tech into their products. In the future, if you want to have the most efficient and cost-effective flying machine of any description, you'll need Seaflight's Flow Control inside. \r\n\r\n",

We launched in India 60 days ago and have grown from 0 to 40k transacting users and hit a monthly GTV of $280K already. We are growing 25% week on week.\r\n\r\nIndia is a nation of savers but the way the majority of India saves is non-smart & does not create wealth. There are 200 Mn Indians who save manually in bank deposits, the returns from these instruments do not even beat India's inflation. \r\n\r\nGold is an instrument that India loves - 30Bn worth gold is purchased in India every year by middle income households. Gold has great cultural significance in India & there is high familiarity with the asset class. Despite gold being a familiar asset class & giving 5% higher returns than bank deposits, 200 Mn Indians still save manually in these non wealth creating bank deposits. This is largely because the ways to save in Gold required painful discrete activities such as manually accumulating money to buy gold, going to offline stores to buy this gold, incurring storage charges & more. The minimum ticket size for purchasing gold at these stores is $50 adding to more friction to saving in Gold.\r\n\r\nUsing automated savings, Gullak now makes it extremely easy for users to save small amounts regularly($1/day) in digital Gold.This was not possible a year ago because the underlying infrastructure(UPI Autopay) was missing. \r\n\r\nWith 50 Mn Indians saving $2/day & with gold backed lending, this is a $1.5Bn market opportunity.\r\n\r\nGullak’s Founding team is the team which built BHIM UPI App(10Mn Downloads in 10 Days), this was launched by the PM of India. We built large scale payment systems for partners like GooglePay / Amazon, processing more than 30Mn payments/day. This is the same team that has built more than 40+ consumer brands & their initial growth strategy.\r\n",

While it is both possible and a worthwhile strategy to attempt to win back a customer during the cancellation process — involuntary churn is not intentional and in most cases, your customers aren’t even aware that their payment failed.\r\n\r\n💰 Bottom line?\r\nEffective payment optimization does reduce involuntary churn and will increase ARR by as much as 5-10%\r\n\r\nFLYCODE SOLUTION 💡\r\nFlyCode leverages ML and AI to provide Payment Optimization and smart payment retries to maximize subscription revenue and reduce churn. We apply a unique model tailored to each Merchant and their customers to ensure optimal results.\r\n\r\n⚡️Automatically recover failed subscription payments and reduce passive churn\r\n\r\n⚡️Use ML & AI based payment optimization to find the best time to charge your customers\r\n\r\n⚡️ Improve customer experience by coordinating payment retries with customer emails/SMS\r\n\r\n🛠️ We support OOTB + Custom Integrations for Merchants and White-Label for Platforms\r\n",

Because the disease is progressive and only gets worse over time, many patients end up on highly addictive, high-dose opioids. \r\nTo date, we have secured $3.7 million in non dilutive funding and completed preclinical testing. We demonstrated that our drug is safe, selectively blocks nerves that transmit pain, and provides pain relief that lasts four times as long. \r\nInsurance currently pays $770 per six-monthly treatment for knee osteoarthritis. With 5 million patients in the US, this represents a $7.7 Bn market opportunity.\r\nThis platform biotherapeutic can also be used to treat other joints affects by osteoarthritis such as the hip and ankle, where the same problems exist in treatment care.

With the rise of EHRs, the manual documentation burden on doctors has never been higher, leading to burnout and fatigue and high attrition rates. Assigning the correct diagnosis and billing codes is crucial for proper reimbursement and patient care, but medical coding is becoming more and more complex each year with growing numbers of codes (over 145,000 now), and doctors are unsupported by current technology to keep up with its ever increasing requirements. $125 billion is left on the table each year by healthcare organizations due to improper documentation and coding. \r\n\r\nKnowtex creates visit notes with up-to-date and accurate reimbursement codes from doctor-patient conversations, allowing the doctor to focus on patient care and preventing revenue leakage for hospital systems through standardized, transparent, and accurate documentation.

We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into specific therapeutic dendritic cells specially trained against that patient’s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body. \r\n\r\nOur therapeutic dendritic cells revitalize the killers of the immune system and give them the kickstart they need to fight - and win - against cancer.",
