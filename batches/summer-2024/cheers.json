  "long_description": "Most corporate initiatives fail at the frontline because companies can't see which employees actually drive results. Without visibility into individual performance, it's impossible to optimize what matters most: the customer experience.\r\n\r\nCheers solves this. Our NFC badges turn every employee interaction into measurable data. Customers tap to leave reviews, join loyalty programs, download apps, or tip, with each action automatically linked to the employee who earned it.\r\n\r\nThis creates the first real-time performance dataset for frontline workers. Managers instantly see who drives 3x more app downloads, which shifts convert best, and exactly where coaching will help. Vivint used Cheers to collect 25,000+ five-star reviews in 60 days, lifting their Google rating from 2.0 to 4.9.\r\n\r\nCheers makes your frontline as measurable and optimizable as your digital channels.",
