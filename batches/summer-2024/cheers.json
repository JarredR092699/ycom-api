  "long_description": "Corporate initiatives fail at the frontline because nobody can track execution or measure employee performance in real time. Cheers closes this last-mile gap. Our NFC badges let customers leave a review, download an app, join a loyalty program, tip, or refer with a single tap, automatically tying every action to the employee who earned it. The result is the first real-time performance dataset for frontline workers. \r\n\r\nManagers see exactly who drives results, which programs convert, and where to coach. Vivint Smart Home used Cheers to capture 16,000+ five-star Google reviews in two months and raised its local Google ratings from ~2.0 to ~4.9 stars. Cheers is turning millions of frontline interactions into actionable data and becoming the intelligence layer of the frontline economy.",
