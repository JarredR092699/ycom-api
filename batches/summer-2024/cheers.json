  "long_description": "Cheers makes frontline employee interactions (with technicians, hospitality staff, field reps) fully observable, measurable, and optimizable. Like Datadog did for cloud infrastructure, Cheers captures frontline touch points and transforms them into clear business insights by letting customers leave reviews, tips, and referrals in the moment, prompted by a simple NFC tap.\r\n\r\nEach interaction captured is attributable to specific employees, allowing Cheers to generate detailed employee performance profiles that managers can utilize for performance reviews, promotions, and coaching, helping them see who is great and who needs support. Vivint Smart Home used these insights to identify top performers and collected over 15,000 five-star Google reviews in two months after implementing Cheers, boosting their average local rating from ~2.0 stars to ~4.9 stars.",
