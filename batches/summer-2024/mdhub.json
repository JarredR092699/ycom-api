  "long_description": "We’re building AI agents to power the next generation of healthcare clinics - starting with mental health.\r\n\r\nOne year ago, we launched our AI Clinical Assistant to help clinicians reclaim their time by automating clinical documentation, pre-charting, and treatment planning. It's now been used in over 1 million patient sessions.\r\n\r\nNow we’ve launched Sarah, our AI Admissions Coordinator, to help patients access care faster by eliminating missed calls, delays, and administrative friction.\r\n\r\nSarah answers every call instantly, 24/7, no voicemails, no hold music. She qualifies new patients and books intakes, while also managing reschedules, cancellations, med refill requests, and appointment confirmations for existing patients.\r\n\r\nClinics using Sarah have seen up to a 30% increase in new patient bookings, while ensuring that 100% of existing patient inquiries are handled, without adding headcount.",
