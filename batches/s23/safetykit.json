  "long_description": "SafetyKit replaces human Trust and Safety reviewers with language models.\r\n\r\nWe make it easy for enterprise Trust and Safety teams to supercharge their content review workflows — speeding up agent decision-making 5x or by automating the review altogether — and significantly reduce operations costs with faster, more accurate decisions.\r\n\r\nWith SafetyKit, Trust and Safety teams write their policies in natural language and use them to detect and action nefarious content, instantly.  Each decision is accompanied by an explanation grounded in your policies — not a generic definition or model score.  We allow TnS teams to confidently scale their capacity, freeing up your agents for the highest leverage work, while reducing those agents exposure to problematic content. ",
