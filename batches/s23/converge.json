  "long_description": "Tracking customer events (e.g. Add To Cart, Purchase, etc.) correctly is important, yet unattainable for most online stores due to the limitations of tracking in the browser and lack of in-house developers.\r\n\r\nConverge auto-tracks all important events â€“ across the browser, store backend and subscription platforms. Once tracking is set up, Converge allows online stores to forward these events with the flip of a switch to their advertising platforms and analytics tools leading to improved ad performance and better insights.\r\n\r\nOur larger vision is to go beyond data infrastructure; and leverage our single customer data layer to build out a perfectly integrated set of applications that helps brands reduce their customer acquisition cost.",
