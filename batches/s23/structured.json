  "long_description": "Structured is a semantic layer that ensures consistent and reliable business metrics across your organization. When different teams define key metrics like CAC and MRR differently, it leads to conflicting reports and poor decisions. Structured connects directly to your cloud data warehouse, enforcing a single, agreed-upon definition for every metric. This eliminates hours of manual reconciliation and aligns your entire company on the same data, enabling faster, more confident decisions. With Structured, your data is consistent, your metrics are trustworthy, and your team can focus on growth, not fixing data issues.",
