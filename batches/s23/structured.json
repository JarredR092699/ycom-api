  "long_description": "Structured is a tool that simplifies data discovery and collaboration for teams, focusing on making data modeling and metric tracking as intuitive as possible. It brings together all your data sources, metadata, and documentation into one place, making it easy to find the right data and understand how it connects. By centralizing data models and metrics, Structured allows teams to work with a unified view of their data, which reduces redundancy and confusion. It’s built for teams that prioritize accuracy and speed, making sure everyone can find and use data without bottlenecks. Essentially, it’s a tool for treating data like code, emphasizing structure and reusability across projects.",
