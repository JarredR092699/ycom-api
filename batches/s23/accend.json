  "long_description": "Accend is a step-by-step guided workflow for Ops & Compliance teams to accelerate and automate manual reviews. Growing B2B Fintechs and BaaS providers continuously face the challenge of inefficiency and low quality output. Accend helps Ops professionals by automatically (i) doing online searches and (ii) generating regulatory reports like CDD/EDD, thereby saving hours per manual process, such as KYB applications, Disputes, Transaction Monitoring, etc. Accend Founders previously led Engineering and Product for Risk at Brex where they saw this problem firsthand while working with Risk Ops & Compliance folks on a daily basis.",
