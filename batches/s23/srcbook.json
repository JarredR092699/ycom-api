  "long_description": "Srcbook is an open-source TypeScript notebook for rapid prototyping, learning, and internal tooling.\r\n\r\nWe believe that in 2024 there is still no productive prototyping environment for JS/TS. Python has Jupyter and streamlit, but what about TypeScript which is largely the language de facto of product teams? Srcbook is the solution to this tooling gap.\r\n\r\nWhether you are prototyping node code, exploring libraries, sharing ideas with your team, building agents, or running evals, srcbook is the best tool for you and your team.\r\n\r\nWe're an open-source company and our vision is to make it dead easy to iterate on ideas and even deploy mini-apps to production incredibly easily.",
