  "long_description": "Autotab is a desktop app for teaching AI to do the work you don’t want to do. You simply show it how to do the task once and Autotab uses AI to learn how to do it for you. Once it has learned a task, Autotab can do it as many times as you want, 24/7/365—no lunch breaks needed.\r\n\r\nAutotab is built for real work: It excels at tasks that are **repetitive**, such as doing the same thing for every item in a list, and **complex** e.g. involving many steps across different software applications. Autotab currently is able to do any task that can be done in a browser, with capabilities to control any application on your computer coming soon.\r\n\r\nOn top of it all, you only pay for the time that Autotab actually spends doing work for you!",
