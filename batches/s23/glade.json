  "long_description": "Glade is building the next generation of video games. Today, games have linear gameplay and fixed content which become stale and repetitive for players. Using AI, Glade is pioneering an entirely new genre of games.\r\n\r\nThe first release from Glade will be Cursed Crown, a multiplayer, rogue-lite game with AI generated content and story progression. Players start the game with a character waking up stranded in a prison alongside their party with their memories erased. The players must escape the prison by climbing each floor, discovering new secrets about their past and how they were captured along the way. Using generative AI, players shape their own story in game and personalize their gaming experience.",
