We use existing metadata to help you create new datasets, connect sources, fix errors, or edit in place.\r\n• Collaborative: Easily share data and discover what others in your org have built as a starting place for your analysis. Wrap common blocks of logic with templates so your team never has to start from zero.\r\n• Resilient and Scalable: Our compute engine is lightning-fast for queries and builds.

This ensures no calls or leads are missed, boosting both customer satisfaction and team efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe car dealership industry handles over 3 billion calls annually, with each call averaging 4 to 6 minutes. Traditional call centers charge between $1 and $2 per minute, depending on the complexity of the service. Thus, we estimate the total addressable market for inbound calls alone to exceed $26 billion a year. This does not even account for future opportunities in outbound calls.\r\n\r\nBefore launching Sandra, the founding team spent years working in the automotive and call center industries during their time at McKinsey.

We’re piloting our AI interpretability technology with early-stage biotechs and scaling rapidly. Just a week after our pivot, we identified the first interpretable features ever found in protein models, allowing precise control over biological functions.\r\n\r\nNithin and John met competing in Biology Olympiads before spending 4 years as roommates at MIT publishing ML/bio research in NeurIPS and Nature. We believe biological models encode far more information than anyone is currently using - our goal is to unlock this potential.",

As hybrid athletes themselves the founders found this frustrating and set out to build the unified approach they needed for their training.\r\n\r\nThree of HYBRD’s founders previously worked at WHOOP, each leading teams across product, growth and analytics. In parallel, Mats was a member of the US national rowing team and Ben, Shoe and Ruiters have all completed Ironman 70.3s. ",
