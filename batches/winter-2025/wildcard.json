  "long_description": "Wildcard helps engineering managers keep velocity high without burning out their team. Our AI agents pick up the tickets that slow teams down — bugs, test fixes, migrations, and more — all in the background. Wildcard integrates with GitHub, Jira, Linear, Sentry, and Datadog to write code, open PRs, and close out tasks automatically. No extra headcount. No missed KPIs.",
