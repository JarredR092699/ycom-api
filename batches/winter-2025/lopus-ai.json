  "long_description": "Revenue teams keep losing deals because CRMs and intent data only tell them who will convert after the fact. Your sales team can't decide who to prioritize, and your pipeline is leaking millions.\r\n\r\nWe've built Lopus Recon, a Revenue Intelligence Platform that analyses millions of data points to guide your sales team to decide exactly which accounts to target and when, and enter calls knowing why they'll convert.\r\n\r\nEngineered by Lopus AI, the GTM weapons lab.",
