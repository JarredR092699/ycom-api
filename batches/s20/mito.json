  "long_description": "Mito is a spreadsheet UI that generates Python code when you edit it. Data analysts use Mito to automate reports without relying on internal engineering resources. \r\n\r\nWe've already signed contracts with two of the largest banks in the world, and just this summer one of them has trained 7k analysts in Mito. We launched Mito open-core in January and surpassed 75k ARR and over 1k GitHub stars. \r\n\r\nOpen source is key to our enterprise sales strategy and we're now building out the enterprise version of Mito so we can sell substantially larger contracts. \r\n\r\nWe decided to build Mito after making the Excel to Python transition ourselves while pursuing dual degrees at Penn. Nate has developed open source Python while doing distributed systems research at the Ethereum Foundation. Aaron made the Excel to Python transition for a second time as an analyst at Capital One. And Jake launched an internal personalization tool at SAP.  \r\n\r\nCheck us out at: https://www.trymito.io/",
