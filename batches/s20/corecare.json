  "long_description": "Getting paid in healthcare is hard. Healthcare providers contract with numerous payors, all of which have their own systems and processes for authorizing payment. Worse, payor systems don't communicate with provider EMRs, so providers are forced to do a lot of manual work between them to get paid. This results in providers spending $300 Billion a year to get paid, and ultimately collect less money than what they are owed.\r\n\r\nCoreCare aggregates administrative patient data from all systems providers work with (EHR, Gov, Payer), standardizes it in our Enterprise Data Warehouse and creates a single net view of administrative patient data for the provider. Then we add workflow automations (according to client specifications) to eliminate the manual work providers are forced to do to get paid. ",
