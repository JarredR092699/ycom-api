  "long_description": "Chatpay allows anyone to create an online coaching business through WhatsApp or Telegram groups. For example a fitness coach can charge her audience to join an exclusive group where she will run an entire weight loss fitness program.\r\n\r\nCovid killed lots of jobs and brought the need for people to reinvent themselves. This accelerated a larger trend of individuals building and charging their audience directly. Our top coach left her job as a lawyer and it's making $300k per year with her groups in Brazil\r\n\r\nChatPay is set to be the largest enabler of this new behavior because we are the only one reaching normal people where they actually are - on messenger apps. Chat wins over long-format content and has better engagement which makes it easier to become mainstream.",
