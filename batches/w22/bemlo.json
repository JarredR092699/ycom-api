  "long_description": "Bemlo empowers healthcare organizations to offer their employees the flexibility they require. Did you know that the US will be 4 million healthcare workers short by 2026? Post-COVID, a record number of professionals have left the industry due to burnout and 3/10 are considering leaving. We increase retention by making it possible for nurses and doctors to work on their terms - without having to go through staffing agencies. Our customers post vacant shifts to their own pools as well as our marketplace of vetted professionals increasing fill rates while keeping expenses manageable.\r\n\r\nWe serve healthcare organizations from single private elder care homes to large public regional healthcare systems with multiple hospitals and thousands of staff.",
