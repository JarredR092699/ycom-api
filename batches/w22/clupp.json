  "long_description": "We offer up to 40% lower premium by focusing on the population which are either low mileage drivers or have good driving habits, representing a $7B market.\r\nInsurance penetration in LatAm is extremely low (30% for cars & 10% for motorcycles). This is because there is not an appropriate product for most vehicles (price, payment options, and distribution channels, etc.). We developed the tech to identify and offer affordable insurance for any vehicle (cars, motorcycles, bikes, scooters) based on mileage and driving habits. Then we added gamification, payment options for the unbanked population, and more.",
