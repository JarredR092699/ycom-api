  "long_description": "We believe that aviation will only be electric in the next decades, and we are fully committed to making this a reality, by building the first electric business aircraft using hydrogen propulsion to reach more than 800 nautical miles. We already completed an 85kW flying bench for retrofitting a 2-seater from G1 aviation. This technology represents a significant advancement in the field of business aviation, offering a more environmentally-friendly and efficient alternative to traditional planes.",
