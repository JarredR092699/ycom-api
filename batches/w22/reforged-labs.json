  "long_description": "Reforged Labs is breaking ground with the launch of its first-of-its-kind AI-powered video creation service, designed specifically for indie and small game studios. We are automating what has long been an expensive and time-consuming creative process, replacing it with lightning-fast delivery of cost-effective video ads tailored to each studio’s marketing needs. At the core of this service is Reforged Labs’ proprietary AI engine, trained by analyzing thousands of high-performing game ads in its reference library. \r\n\r\nStudios can select from a streamlined ‘storefront’ of ad templates modeled after the opening hooks, content format, and narrative flows from successful ads for games similar to their own. Game developers simply upload gameplay recordings and Reforged Labs’ AI will identify key scenes and moments that showcase the game’s most impactful features and designs. Reforged Labs delivers finished ads in less than 24 hours, saving game studios both time and money. \r\n\r\nWe’re a small and nimble team with backgrounds from Google, Microsoft, and Harvard, and we’re backed by world-class investors, including DCM, Y Combinator, the founder of King and Sky Mavis, and executives from Niantic and Pocket Gems.",
