  "long_description": "Bobidi helps AI companies validate the AI models very fast and improve them 10x more efficiently.  It is critical because AI companies are having hard times predicting the unknown-unknowns and thus how the model will perform in the real world.  \r\n\r\nOur underlying magic is that we run a global gamified community that is incentivized to test and find the edge cases that the model missed.  The whole process would be 10x more efficient than the industry norm that takes as long as a couple of months.  \r\n\r\nThis is the mashup between the community and AI, the areas we (the co-founders) are the experts of, bringing experiences from Facebook and Google & Niantic, respectively.  Both have exited before as CEO (Social Commerce Startup in Korea) and CTO (AR Startup acquired by Niantic), respectively.",
