  "long_description": "Hydra is an open source, analytics database that makes it easy to build apps, analytics, and ML on real-time data. It operates 100-1000X faster than traditional analytics databases (OLAP) that require data ingestion and transformation from external data source like Postgres and Amazon S3. With Hydra, high performance analytical processing runs directly on live transactions and real-time event data with zero-ETL.\r\n\r\nEvery Hydra project includes a fully managed Postgres database, integrated analytical processing, and bottomless, globally distributed object storage so you can ship sub-second analytics with any application in an afternoon.",
