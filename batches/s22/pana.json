Head of Digital Banking at Scotiabank for LatAm, and along with co-founder and the rest of the team which comes from Rover, Rappi, and mercado libre, have all personally lived through the struggles of migrating to the USA.\r\n\r\nLatinos represent the fastest- growing -and one of the most underserved- population in the USA in part because Big Banks are not really interested in this segment or have other priorities. A good product and service like Pana that speaks to our needs and worries is long overdue.",
