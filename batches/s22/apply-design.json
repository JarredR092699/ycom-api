  "long_description": "Apply Design helps homebuyer reimagine their new home using AI.\r\n\r\nWe provide homebuyers access to a website that showcases their next home images augmented with hundreds of photorealistic interior designs, all size-accurate and curated by professional designers. These designs are created using real furniture from top brands. \r\nWe help homebuyers see the potential of their next home and turn that into a reality.\r\nFor example, when a young married couple with a baby visits the website we host, instead of seeing a dull property listing on Zillow with empty pictures or old furniture, the family sees realistic and personalized virtual interior designs – such as a home office and a baby room – which we automatically generate for them. They can then play with those designs and see how that home fits their needs and tastes and buy those furniture directly from Apply Design.\r\n\r\nThis is a $20B market opportunity, given the 50M properties sold or rented annually in North America and Europe alone.
