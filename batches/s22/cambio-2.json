  "long_description": "Cambio is software that helps commercial real estate companies and their corporate tenants decarbonize their buildings. The need to achieve net zero emissions in commercial real estate has never been greater as 60% of the Fortune 500 have issued climate pledges and 50 municipalities have mandated building emissions reductions. We help our customers measure the carbon footprint of their buildings and identify high-impact retrofits that drive both cost savings and decarbonization.\r\n\r\nWe are building the solution we wished we had while working as real estate investors at firms like KKR, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Oxford Properties.\r\n",
