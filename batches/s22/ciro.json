  "long_description": "Sales is about building relationships 🤝 — but you wouldn’t know it from watching most sales teams today. The average sales rep spends 1-2 days per week researching and list-building instead of spending time with customers. \r\n\r\nWe’re building the most comprehensive index of businesses and contacts, combined with powerful data connectors and workflow automation that give salespeople superpowers. Our stodgy competitors have been around for 100 years and have not innovated in decades. Modern sales teams deserve better!\r\n\r\nCiro is a tight-knit team of engineers, sales execs, and product managers with experience from Stanford, Google, Meta, Flexport, and Bain & Co. Our CEO and COO have both served as VPs of Sales at high-growth SaaS startups and understand our domain deeply. We are backed by some of the best investors in the world, including Y Combinator, SV Angel, CRV, and the founders of Tegus, BuildZoom, and Flexport.",
