  "long_description": "Boostly is an SMS marketing platform for restaurants, which uses behavioral-based marketing and gamified texting experiences to get 10x greater engagement than merely sending an offer. For example, Boostly connects to all available sources of customer data for a restaurant, and sends targeted messages to the consumers based on their personal engagement with the brand. This might include steeper incentives for customers which haven’t engaged with the restaurant for a while, and could include a gamified experience to increase the likelihood of a customer response.\r\n\r\nBoostly also provides an automated phone assistant which handles call-in orders without staff intervention. This improves the restaurant’s efficiency, maximizes revenue, and, of course, automatically engages the restaurant’s customers through our SMS marketing to drive additional future orders.",
