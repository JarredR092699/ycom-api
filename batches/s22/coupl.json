  "long_description": "Coupl is India's first neobank for couples. \r\nWe help couples easily manage their shared payments.\r\n\r\nWhile Indian couples have evolved over the last 20 years, the traditional joint account hasn't.\r\n\r\nToday, young Indian couples start sharing payments well before tying the knot. They use multiple tools to budget, split, track and settle expenses. They also prefer a quick and digital banking experience. \r\nHowever, the traditional joint account is still only accessible to married couples, takes days to open and is very limited in its expense management features & user experience.\r\n\r\nCoupl lets any young couple (regardless of their marital status) open a digital joint wallet in under 60 seconds using the mobile app - without ever having to visit a physical bank branch.\r\nCustomers can use the Coupl wallet to pool in money together and pay for shared expenses using our RuPay cards.",
