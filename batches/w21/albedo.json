  "long_description": "Albedo is developing low-flying satellites that will capture visible and thermal imagery at the highest resolution commercially available. By making aerial quality imagery globally available, easy to purchase, and transparent to task, we aim to catalyze market growth and spur new applications.  \r\n\r\nThe world is rapidly changing and a new level of visibility and transparency is required to solve some of our largest problems. Albedoâ€™s 10cm visible and 2m thermal imagery will fuel insights for industries such as mapping, insurance, utilities, solar, agriculture, carbon offsets, infrastructure sustainability, national security, and much more.",
