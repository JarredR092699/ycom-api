  "long_description": "Up to 90% of skin aging is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun. We can protect against this by wearing sunscreen every day, but most people don’t. There are two reasons for this. First, most people don’t know that most skin aging is caused by cumulative sun exposure, even on cloudy days. And second, sunscreens are greasy. At Lygg, we’ve developed new ingredients that can triple the anti-aging protection of sunscreens and eliminate their greasiness. Our goal is to make wearing sunscreen a part of everyone’s daily routine.",
