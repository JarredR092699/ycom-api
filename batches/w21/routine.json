  "long_description": "Routine is on a mission to help extremely busy people stay on top of things. CEOs, entrepreneurs, investors, senior executive and general managers evolve in a very chaotic environment with hundreds of emails, chat messages, things going through their mind and important tasks that must be completed in time.\r\n\r\nEven though a lot of tools exist, from email clients, todo and note taking apps all the way to project management platforms and physical notebooks, none of them seem to work when it comes to having an overall picture of what matters at the moment.\r\n\r\nRoutine is a personal productivity desktop/mobile app that is always at the user's fingertips through a single keyboard shortcut. It allows busy people to quickly capture thoughts, secure time in their calendar to work on important tasks, schedule meetings, take notes but also quickly glance at their calendar to know when is their next meeting.\r\n\r\nRoutine has been created in 2020 by Julien Quintard and Quentin Hocquet, serial entrepreneurs who previously founded Infinit which they sold to [Docker](http://www.docker.com) in 2016.",
