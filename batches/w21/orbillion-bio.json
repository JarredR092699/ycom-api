  "long_description": "Intro to Orbillion Bio: https://youtu.be/Rql0eteqQ-o\r\n\r\nOrbillion Bio will be the first company to bring premium lab grown meat to the market. We will replace prime beef and wagyu with an ethical alternative that tastes amazing. The founders Patricia Bubner, PhD, Samet Yildirim, MSc, MBS and Gabriel Levesque-Tremblay, PhD have over 30 years of combined experience in business and product development, bioprocessing and biopharma. After only 4 months of development time, Orbillion has four different flavorful meats growing in the lab: wagyu beef, elk, sheep and American bison. Using their proprietary platform technology, Orbillion is rapidly decreasing the cost of cultivated meat. Major investors in our pre seed round were Y Combinator, New Protein Fund, Joyance Partners and Venture Souq. https://www.orbillion.com/",
