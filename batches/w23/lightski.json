  "long_description": "Lightski is an AI rich-text editor specifically built for software engineers. We take the grunt work out of drafting technical docs by marrying an AI Assistant with your Github, allowing it to write for you.\r\n\r\nLightski connects to your Github and comes with an AI agent that automatically searches your codebase to write for you. Afterwards, continue refining the doc in our Notion-like editor, where you can collaborate, iterate, and comment on the doc.\r\n",
