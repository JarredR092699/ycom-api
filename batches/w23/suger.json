  "long_description": "The cloud marketplaces on AWS, Azure, and GCP have become the App Store for B2B software products. Itâ€™s growing close to 100% year-over-year since it gives software sellers access to cloud budgets and makes procurement 40% faster. The core problem is the cloud marketplace is hard to navigate and requires an upfront technical investment without knowing the expected ROI. Suger eliminates the need to reinvent the wheel with your own engineering resource or spend a fortune on consulting-based solutions. ",
