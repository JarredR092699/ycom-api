  "long_description": "APIs underpin the internet but are still painful to work with. They are often untyped, unstandardized, and out-of-sync across multiple sources of truth.\r\n\r\nFern enables businesses to offer “Stripe-level” SDKs (client libraries) and Docs for their REST API. Inspired by internal tooling we saw at AWS and Palantir, we’re building Fern to let every engineering team offer easy-to-use and well-documented APIs.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2022, we’re less than 10 people, building open source, and backed by YCombinator. We work together in our office in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Our customers include Cohere, ElevenLabs, Pinecone, Webflow, and Merge.dev.",
