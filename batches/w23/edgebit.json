  "long_description": "Dependencies for software products are exploding in number and with that comes a sprawling supply chain. A supply chain isn't just a build-time check, it's highly dynamic. EdgeBit watches in real time – we cross-reference your build pipelines and server fleet with multiple data sources to communicate your live inventory and actual risk.\r\n\r\nSecurity teams aren’t experts at their company’s apps, so they are forced to distract the most skilled engineers with a firehose of vulnerabilities to investigate. We founded EdgeBit because we believe that we can solve this problem — to empower security teams to prioritize investigation of true risks without wasting engineers time.",
