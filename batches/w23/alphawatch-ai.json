  "long_description": "AlphaWatch AI is a research and analysis platform designed for hedge funds and private equity firms. By using custom LLMs, specialized embedding models, and integrating with both trusted external data sources and secure private data, AlphaWatch AI offers a reliable chat interface that cites its sources, saving financial professionals time on research. \r\n\r\nWe aim to solve a very real pain point: data is currently disjointed, and hedge funds spend anywhere from 250k to 1M on data costs. While LLMs should solve a research problem, their results are prone to hallucinations and don't include internal information.\r\n\r\nWith efficient data integration and valuable insights, AlphaWatch AI is enhancing the way financial institutions access essential information and make informed decisions while maintaining data privacy",
