  "long_description": "Iliad is a creative tool for generating images and 3D models.\r\n\r\nIliad can make characters, environments, avatars, game icons, designs, backgrounds, textures, and materials.\r\n\r\nRight now, it's free for up to 50 images and 5 3D models per day.\r\n\r\nThe transform setting gives you fully continuous, granular control over your generations, so you can color sketch out what you want and guide your visual ideas into refined images. It's the best image-to-image interface.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to create detailed 3D meshes and voxel art from your images using the 3D pipeline.",
