  "long_description": "Finic provides browser infrastructure for developers building web scrapers, browser automations, and AI agents. Only 20% of the work involved in building a web scraper or automation is writing the code - the other 80% is making sure it works in production.\r\n\r\nThis involves routing requests through residential proxies, saving and loading session cookies, fixing broken selectors, and dozens of other tasks that are needed to make the automation resilient to website updates and bot detectors.\r\n\r\nFinic handles this network level infrastructure so developers can focus on the business logic. They get a browser in the cloud configured to be indistinguishable from humans, and which can be controlled remotely using libraries they're already familiar with like Playwright or Puppeteer.",
