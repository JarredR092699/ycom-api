Every day, hundreds of thousands of warehouses have trucks waiting in lines because scheduling and check in is currently done with email, spreadsheets and paper. Conduit automates these processes to help trucks get in and out faster and warehouses get products in and out faster. \r\n\r\nConduit is easy to integrate with shipper transportation and warehouse management systems, as well as carrier and broker systems.
