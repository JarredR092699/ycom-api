  "long_description": "Automate inbound and outbound phone calls with hyper realistic AI. Companies use Vocode to replace and augment their call center operations at a fraction of the cost. Spin off AI phone calls in a single line of code https://vocode.dev \r\n\r\nOur open source library makes it easy for developers to build voice-based LLM applications. We provide abstractions for streaming 2-way conversation (this is good for realtime apps like phone calls) and for command-based/turn-based applications (like voice-based chess). The library has integrations to most major speech recognition/synthesis providers and platform support across web and telephony (via Twilio).\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to get up and running–simple use cases are just 10 lines of code. Check out our docs for more information: https://docs.vocode.dev",
