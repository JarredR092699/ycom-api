  "long_description": "Credal protects your sensitive data across all AI apps. We ensure everyone at your company can get the benefits of AI like ChatGPT, without risking business secrets or protected data like PII making it into AI training. Think \"Okta for AI\".\r\n\r\nCredal gives you four layers of security:\r\n1. Automatic redaction, anonymisation, or user warnings when sensitive data is about to be sent off network\r\n2. Our Secure Chat UI and APIs provide audit logs on every interaction with external AI, allowing you to see what data has been shared with which providers and what Terms of Service or MSA's govern each one.\r\n3. We provide a wrapper around all the major providers of Large Language Models, so we can automatically direct your requests to the most appropriate AI for your particular request (based on data sensitivity, context window, cost, etc.)\r\n4. We get sensible MSA's in place with all major external providers, so your data cannot be retained for more than 30 days or used to train models.",
