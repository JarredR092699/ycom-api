  "long_description": "Sherloq is like Github for data teams. Companies use us as their single source of truth for their SQL on top of their existing data stack.\r\n\r\nToday, data-driven organizations face the challenge of giving 2 of their data analysts the same task and getting 2 totally different results from their analysis. Although SQL is the #1 coding language for data analysis, it is still managed independently on each user's internal documentation tools (notepads, Slack channels, or docx files).\r\nCreating one source of truth is an ongoing difficult process, thatâ€™s done manually and takes time to implement. \r\n\r\nUsing our plugin on top of our user's existing query editors, companies can now manage their SQL code in one place.\r\nWe ourselves are data users and we've built Sherloq to fit the exact needs of data teams, becoming a true alternative to the way SQL is being managed today.",
