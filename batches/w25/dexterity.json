  "long_description": "Dex is the intelligent interface built for coworking with AI—right on top of your browser.\r\n\r\nMost AI agents today are designed for set-and-forget tasks—you hand them off and check back later. But what about the workflows you'd want to drive? Jumping between tabs, browsing sites, filling forms, and searching across apps—these experiences demand instant, context-aware models that work with you, not just for you.\r\n\r\nDex turns your browser into an intelligent workspace that understands your intent. With simple voice and text, it enhances familiar interfaces, automates mundane actions, and helps you do everything 10x faster.\r\n\r\nNo more slow handoffs. No more context-switching. Just AI that moves at your speed.",
