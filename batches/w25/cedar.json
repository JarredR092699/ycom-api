  "long_description": "Law practice is intellectual work trapped in a mesh of administrative tasks. We’re building AI agents that automate pre-litigation workflows for personal injury law firms. \r\n\r\nFrom AI voice agents that take the initial client intake call to drafting discovery requests and analyzing responses for motions to compel, new workflows can now be automated with the advent of voice and reasoning models.\r\n\r\nPersonal injury is a $57 billion market in the U.S. alone, with a contingency fee billing model that incentivizes efficiency (unlike other practices of law billed hourly). In high-quality firms, each attorney can make upwards of 3.5 million per year– saving even 1% of their time is significant. We're working on saving >30% of their time. \r\n\r\nThe founders, Jesse and Isabelle, met at Georgia Tech, where they graduated with degrees in Computer Science. They’ve worked on projects together for 4 years, while gaining industry experience as software engineers at LinkedIn, Intuit, Notion, and Figma.",
