  "long_description": "At ReJot, we're building a synchronization engine to modernize sharing data between backend services within larger organizations. Traditional approaches for internal data transfer such as HTTP requests and event streaming require significant effort to implement and maintain. The biggest hurdle however, is the coordination required to get teams to start the actual integration work.\r\n\r\nOur approach is based on synchronization, teams define what data their backend publishes and requires, and we'll make sure everything is reactively up-to-date. By being declarative about integrations, project management overhead as well as technical integration burdens are avoided. ReJot uses your existing infrastructure such as Postgres and Kafka.\r\n",
