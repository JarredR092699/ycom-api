  "long_description": "Promptless automatically updates your customer-facing documentation, including tutorials, how-to guides, API specs, knowledge bases, support articles, and blog posts. This content is often one of the first points of contact between your product and its users. Clear, accurate, and up-to-date docs are critical, influencing buying decisions, reducing support overhead, and increasing LTV. \r\n\r\nProviders like Readme and Mintlify effectively host your docs, but keeping them updated remains a serious challenge. Working alongside your hosting provider, Promptless lets you configure triggers so that your docs get automatically updated upon new feature releases, developer support questions, or internal use-case discussions. \r\n\r\nPromptless integrates directly with your organization’s entire knowledge ecosystem – issue trackers, internal knowledge bases, support ticket systems, and more – leading to holistic doc updates without expensive coordination between product, engineering, and support teams. \r\n\r\nWith Promptless, documentation becomes a strategic advantage for growth, not a bottleneck or a liability.
