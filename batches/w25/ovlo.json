Unlike traditional search functions that often fail with simple queries, Ovlo understands and processes nuanced user requests, ensuring they find exactly what they need.\r\n\r\nOur solution integrates seamlessly within minutes, eliminating the need for complex setups or extensive developer resources. Founded by a team of experts from Meta, Google, and Amazon, Ovlo delivers enterprise-grade technology to merchants without the typical six-figure implementation costs.",
