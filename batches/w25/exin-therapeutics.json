  "long_description": "We’re building a precision genetic therapy platform that targets neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders from a circuit-level perspective. Current approaches pursue single-gene fixes that only help small subsets of patients, leaving a multi-million patient population without effective treatment options.\r\n\r\n\r\nGene therapy opens the door to precisely modifying brain circuits. The problem is the elevated risk in neuroscience drug discovery. To solve this, we use a pre-clinical screening platform, multiple gene therapy candidates, and ML analytics to develop gene therapies capable of controlling neural activity and addressing neurological conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease.\r\n\r\n",
