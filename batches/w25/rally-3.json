  "long_description": "We're building the financial platform for the future of mobility. Businesses across Europe spend more than â‚¬1 trillion on fuel, charging, and other fleet expenses each year, but the payment infrastructure they rely on hasn't changed since the 1980s. Rally sets a new standard for fleet finance, automating everything from payments to bookkeeping, credit, taxes, driver payroll, and more - helping businesses on the move like delivery services, construction crews, and service technicians stay in control and operate more efficiently.",
