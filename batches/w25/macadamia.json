  "long_description": "We’re building autonomous AI agents that take over the role of engineers in running simulations with advanced physics-based solvers, like Ansys. Engineers submit their CAD designs and simulation requests, and Oswald automates the entire process - from model setup to interpreting results. It’s integrated with Ansys, the industry leader in engineering simulations.",
