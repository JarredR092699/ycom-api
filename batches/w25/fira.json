  "long_description": "Fira is a financial research assistant that helps analysts at investment firms instantly extract and analyse data from unstructured reports of public and private companies. It reads thousands of integrated unstructured financial reports (often 300 pages) to provide source-cited answers and verifiable calculations\r\n\r\nWe're initially focusing on boutique investment banks and M&A advisory firms, covering annual reports of international companies and allowing to upload custom documents. As we develop our product and build clients' trust, we'll eventually integrate directly into clouds.\r\n\r\nUsing accurate extraction and analysis as single unit of work LLMs do, our vision is to scale it with agents to allow deeper and more thoughtful research, report generation and task execution â€” allowing financial teams to focus on ideas and decisions.",
