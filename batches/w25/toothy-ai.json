  "long_description": "Toothy is using AI to automate back office operations for dental clinics. We're building a reality where a dental clinic only needs 3 types of employees: dentists, hygienists, and dental assistants. Every other role is to be done by AI. \r\n\r\nAt our first clinic we've already managed to cut back office staff in half in the two months we've been operating with them. We charge 40% of what overseas BPOs do for the equivalent labor, and a fraction of what in-house employees cost.",
