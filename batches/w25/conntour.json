  "long_description": "Conntour lets governments and corporates query their security cameras. Users can search past footage (“Find a man with a blue backpack”), set alerts (“Alert me if someone climbs over the wall”), and extract data (“How many vehicles entered yesterday?”).\r\n\r\nWe recently secured our first paying customer - the Singapore government - paying $80K for a 3-month trial. If successful, this trial will lead to a contract worth ~$2M/year.\r\n\r\nMatan (CEO) led a military video surveillance unit, leveraging security cameras to save lives. Tomer (CTO) is a second-time founder and former director of engineering.\r\n\r\nThe problem with existing solutions is that they offer low customization, as they’re limited to pre-defined parameters (like shirt color or license plate number). This lack of flexibility causes missed critical events, too many false alarms, and countless hours wasted on manual footage review. Conntour solves this by offering unlimited flexibility through natural language queries - just ask anything.",
