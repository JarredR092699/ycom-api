  "long_description": "Orbital Operations is developing a high thrust space vehicle that is refuellable and stays in orbit to ferry customers beyond low earth orbit (LEO). This allows satellite customers to take advantage of the low cost, low lead time, and low effort launches to LEO and have us rendezvous with them in space to transport them to their final destination.\r\n\r\nOur high thrust and high efficiency is made possible by a unique cryogenic fuel management system being implemented on the vehicle to keep propellants cold so they don't boil. This allows us to use the same propulsion systems that have been developed by launch vehicles over the last few decades (NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin, Relativity Space, ect.).\r\n\r\nBen and Ross met while working together at Relativity Space, where they qualified the cryogenic flight termination valves for the Terran 1 rocket and continued working together on the heat exchangers and turbomachinery for the AeonR engine.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on the first demo of our unique cryo management system and intend to launch an operational vehicle by 2027.
