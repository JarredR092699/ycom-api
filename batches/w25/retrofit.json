We are building AI agents to aggregate the most in-demand inventory from vintage stores nationwide and create detailed, visually compelling listings for each item.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a vintage enthusiast or a first-timer you can discover unique sought-after pieces easily. Retrofit makes vintage shopping feel like shopping on Nordstromâ€” rather than digging through piles of low quality listings on existing secondhand marketplaces. For sellers, Retrofit offers tools to list quickly and to connect their inventory with the right audience on our marketplace. ",
