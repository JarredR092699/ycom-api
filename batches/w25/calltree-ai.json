  "long_description": "Calltree helps enterprises' VP of Operations understand how to make their call center more efficient. Our AI agent analyzes millions of minutes of call center recordings to find inefficiencies in workflows and quantifies the cost of each action. For example, when a rep is handling a credit card dispute, Calltree can identify that reps spend 30 seconds per call on manual data gathering and data entry, propose a solution, and measure the opex savings. Calltree surfaces these insights in an analytics tool and generates reports, making it easy for operation leaders to build business cases to prioritize improvements, realizing millions in opex savings.\r\n\r\nSee us at https://calltree.ai",
