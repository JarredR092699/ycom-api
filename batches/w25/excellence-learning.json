  "long_description": "Aiming at complementing/replacing private tutoring and long-term study programs such as Kumon (over 30B TAM).\r\n\r\nExcellence is a web app for both ambitious and struggling students to learn math. As we believe each student is unique, we adapt our high quality courses and exercices to their knowledge and learning style in a very granular way. To facilitate learning, they get detailed text, voice and graphical explanations, can craft study plans, revise and memorize, and received human mentorship if needed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we offer a program with daily courses and exercices, detailed feedback on their worksheets and more (super Kumon).\r\n\r\nFinally we sell the AI tutoring and exercise databases to schools in a B2B and B2B2C model and already work for the most prestigious institutions in France (Ecole polytechnique, college Stanislas...).\r\n\r\nWe're a passionate team of ex-quants, mathematicians and physics champions devoted to improving science education.",
