  "long_description": "Mesh is an AI bookkeeper for startups. Our chat interface lets founders instantly ask questions about their financials, while our system autonomously reconciles transactions daily. Founders can now make informed decisions in real timeâ€”not 10+ days after the month-end close.\r\n\r\nCurrently, founders have to choose between doing their own bookkeeping or using outsourced accountants who lack context. Despite basic automation tools, companies waste 40-80 hours monthly reconciling scattered data. Mesh connects data across your tech stack and then writes to your general ledger, allowing founders to quickly answer questions like, what are my top spend areas this month?\r\n\r\nThe founders bring combined 10+ years of experience building accounting automation at Carta, where they scaled the fund administration business from $20M to $100M ARR and built their general ledger. Across SMB, MM, and ENT spending an average of $12K to ~1-2% of their revenue on accounting, this is a $125B opportunity. ",
