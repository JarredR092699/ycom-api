  "long_description": "Mesh is building your AI finance team. Mesh is the single, unified interface through which founders can ask questions on their financials, pay taxes and bills, collect invoices, run payroll, and more.  \r\n\r\nNandini and Erin worked together for 5+ years at Carta, and helped grow the fund accounting business from $20M to $100M ARR. Leveraging their insights from Carta, theyâ€™re now automating accounting and finance for SMBs. \r\n\r\nAfter talking to 50+ companies, they realized that what companies need is a better finance partner. Our agents will meet founders exactly where they are by integrating with the existing tech stack and being accessible across various communication channels (i.e. Email, WhatsApp, Chat, Phone, Zoom). \r\n\r\nWithin 1 week of launching on ProductHunt, they have 20 paying customers at $27K ARR, and became the #1 Fintech of the Week.\r\n\r\nThere are 35M SMBs in the US and 358M globally. At $5K average ACV, this presents a $175B US alone, and $1.8T globally.",
