  "long_description": "Mesh builds domain-specific AI agents to automate repetitive accounting tasks like cash reconciliation, expense wires, and inter-company transactions. Whatever tasks accounting firms are currently outsourcing abroad for reduced labor costs, we automate entirely.\r\n\r\nAt Carta, we spent 5+ years working together to automate accounting. We helped grow Carta's fund accounting business from $20M to $100M, transformed offline excel tasks into automated workflows, and increased customer satisfaction score by over 50% by creating an internal workspace for task coordination. \r\n\r\nUntil now, the only way to scale accounting firms was to hire more employees and outsource more work. With Mesh, accountants can save time on each task, save money on hiring additional resources, and use their extra capacity to exponentially grow their business.\r\n\r\nWith a current shortage of 340,000 accountants in the US, along with the alarming statistic that 75% of certified public accountants (CPAs) will reach retirement within the next 15 years, AI has a critical role to play. And we want to be the ones to automate this $63bn outsourced accounting and finance industry.\r\n\r\nOur AI agents work long hours, so accountants don't need to.",
