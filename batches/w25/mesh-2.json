  "long_description": "Mesh is building a fully agentic, AI finance team for companies. Mesh agents build and retain context by connecting to the company's entire financial stack, and automate entire functions within finance ranging from bank reconciliation, accounts receivable / payable, financial reporting, and budgeting / forecasting.  \r\n\r\nNandini and Erin met at Carta where they helped grow the fund accounting business from $20M to $100M ARR. They worked together for 5+ years as engineering and product counterparts. Nandini graduated with BS / MS degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering at CMU, and Erin graduated from WashU on a full-ride scholarship.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to 50+ companies, they realized that what companies needed was a better finance partner instead of another financial dashboard. Because agents keep the books updated in real-time, non-finance teams (i.e. product, sales, operations) are able to make informed decisions faster. \r\n\r\nIn 4 weeks since inception of this idea, they have taken 5 customers live, have $1.6K MRR, and have 60+ customers in the pipeline. \r\n\r\nIn the US, there are 220,000 mid-market and enterprise companies. On average, we can charge $100K, presenting a $22B market opportunity in US alone.",
