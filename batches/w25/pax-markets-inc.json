  "long_description": "High frequency traders (\"HFTs\") pay handsomely to co-locate (\"co-lo\") their algorithms near to the exchange. PAX is building a \"co-lo on a chip,\" moving traders to within nanometers of the exchange -- closer than ever before possible. \r\n\r\nPAX unlocks unprecedented value for HFTs and shares this value with every other market participant on every trade, regardless of order characterization as making or taking. We call this PAX zero-fee + cash-back. \r\n\r\nPAX is launching as a centralized crypto exchange (CEX) with BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC, and will relentlessly pursue its co-lo on a chip technology across all crypto, crypto derivatives, and other asset classes and capital markets. \r\n\r\nPete and Ben have spent years working as high-frequency traders, from crypto to traditional markets.",
