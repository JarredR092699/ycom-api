  "long_description": "ion design is re-imagining how front end works.\r\n\r\nFor early stage companies, ion allows you to describe a UI in text & get react code that’s tailor-made to your business. ion understands your design system and codebase to generate designs that are beautiful and code that’s easy to work with.\r\n\r\nOnce you've scaled and hired a designer, ion offers a pipeline that automatically converts Figma designs into clean React code that's tailor-fitted to your codebase. We re-use your existing components and variables from your codebase in our generations and can automatically generate PRs and merge conflicts from Figma.\r\n",
