  "long_description": "Tower lets overworked and under-resourced in-house legal teams automate and manage incoming requests so they can leave work at 5PM everyday. When a new request arrives via email or chat, Tower automatically extracts necessary context, drafts a first response to the inquirer, and populates a Jira-like dashboard so in-house counsels can track all matters in real-time. Tower also allows counsels to use natural language to search through all matters, including communications and documents.\r\n\r\nIn-house counsels currently spend 30 to 90 (!)% of their day working on highly repetitive, manual tasks; Tower frees them to work on more value-add and meaningful projects.",
