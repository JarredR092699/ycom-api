Our target audience already spends thousands of hours doing math questions competitively, and we've *already* gotten the best of the best to switch to doing problems on our site - an average of 65 minutes a day among our 200 most active users, and a total of over 150,000 arithmetic questions solved in just the last week! Why? Because it is more thrilling and exciting to compete live, see yourself on a leaderboard, and improve your 'ELO' rating. \r\n\r\nWe are USA Math Olympians, and have been the top power users on every single product marketed towards competitive math learners. What's missing is the math game that allows anyone at any level to play with math on demand and compete live at their level, whether it's in the back of an Uber or while training for a math competition.",
