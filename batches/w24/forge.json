  "long_description": "Forge gets companies refunds on duties-taxes paid on imported goods when goods are exported or scrapped by automating duty drawbacks. \r\n\r\nBillions of dollars of eligible refunds go unclaimed every year. We automate the process so that all businesses involved in importing goods can unlock the revenue they deserve.\r\n\r\nEmir and Haris are brothers with backgrounds in both software and hardware supply chain. While developing rocket engines, Emir saw firsthand how poor supply chain operations caused huge issues throughout a company.",
