Trillions of dollars of purchases at the most advanced manufacturing companies are managed across spreadsheets, emails, and meetings - we automate this.\r\n\r\nEmir and Haris are brothers with backgrounds in both software and hardware engineering. While developing rocket engines, Emir saw firsthand how poor procurement operations caused weeks to months of delay, bottlenecking the pace of development.\r\n\r\nOur product lets teams collaborate with manufacturers, track orders from quote to delivery, manage purchase approvals, and more!",
