  "long_description": "Yondu develops models that allow robots to understand and intelligently carry out complex commands. The models are trained on data across various robotic platforms on different modalities of tasks. The models serve as a control policy for devices that need to make decisions, whether they be drones for reconnaissance, robot dogs for inspections, or cameras for smart surveillance. Yondu offers our models to robotics service providers through an API and license. Additionally, Yondu sells off-the-shelf hardware with our custom models to provide smart robots for tasks that benefit from improved human-robot interaction. Our first product is a drone you can control with your voice. ",
