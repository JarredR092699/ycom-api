  "long_description": "DryMerge lets people automate work with plain English. Say you want to manage inbound leads. Instead of dragging blocks or writing code, just tell DryMerge \"Whenever I get an email from a potential customer, add their details to a google sheet and draft a reachout message\" and watch it happen in seconds.\r\n\r\nCounterintuitively, 88% of no-code users are actually programmers. We're changing that by making automation as fast and intuitive as conversation. This opens up the market to all knowledge workers, not just technical ones, and expands it by an order of magnitude. ",
