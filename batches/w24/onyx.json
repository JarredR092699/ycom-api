  "long_description": "Onyx is the AI assistant that connects to all your company tools and docs and makes finding any piece of information a breeze. Think ChatGPT, but with access to all your companies documents (only the ones you have access to, of course :P). Or, if you know Glean, you can think about it like an open-source Glean. \r\n\r\nConcerned about your data? Don't worry we're open source (MIT license) and built to be self-hosted. You can setup Onyx in your VPC in less than 30 minutes - no packets ever have to leave your cloud.\r\n\r\nCheck us out on Github: https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx!",
