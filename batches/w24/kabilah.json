  "long_description": "Currently, 80% of serious medical errors occur at patient handoff. Kabilah improves the patient handoff workflow by replacing commonplace paper report sheets with AI-powered advocates for each patient. Within seconds, nurses can get up to date on patient medical histories via generated summaries and interactive chats with EHR data. A dynamic set of components allows for customized advocates, only displaying pertinent information about each patient. At the end of each shift, a single click allows the outgoing nurse to send auto-generated patient handoff notes. Not only is Kabilah elevating efficiency while alleviating burnout, but it's also empowering nurses to improve patient outcomes.\r\n",
