  "long_description": "Building a UGC platform where anyone can create games like Skyrim or Black Myth Wukong without knowing how to code.\r\n\r\nThe first stage in the road map is our inaugural game, Wizard Cats (https://store.steampowered.com/app/3176500/Wizard_Cats/), with spells, quests, and worlds powered by our engine. Through this Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1el1et6/were_making_a_game_where_llms_power_spell_and/), we captured the imagination of gamers and found an initial group of playtesters. The next stage is to advance the engine to power generated 3D environments / mechanics and allow any user to create their own open world RPGs.\r\n\r\nWe are three friends who met in undergrad at Princeton. Derrick published multiple papers on LLMs while at Google Research, all of which were accepted to NeurIPS. Jason worked as a full stack engineer at both Google and Duolingo. And Alan was a HFT quant trader at Virtu developing algorithms to trade options.",
