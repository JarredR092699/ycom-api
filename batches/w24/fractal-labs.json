Our vision is a UGC platform where this engine enables users to effortlessly create immersive worlds.\r\n\r\nThe first stage in the road map is our inaugural game, Wizard Cats (https://store.steampowered.com/app/3176500/Wizard_Cats/), with spells, quests, and worlds powered by our engine.

The next stage is to advance the engine to power generated 3D environments / mechanics and allow any user to create their own open world RPGs.\r\n\r\nFounded by three friends who met in undergrad at Princeton, our experience includes AI at Google Research, engineering at Google & Duolingo, and quant trading at Virtu.",
