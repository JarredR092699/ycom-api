  "long_description": "OffDeal is building an AI-native investment bank for buying and selling small businesses. \r\n\r\nWe use custom AI agents and big data to screen thousands of SMBs each day, matching buyers with the perfect acquisition target in days instead of months. Unlike legacy M&A advisors, we can search for targets for hundreds of buyers concurrently, 24/7. \r\n\r\nWe are a full stack company and own the entire value chain - from first party SMB data and proprietary algorithms, to custom AI tooling and SMB relationships. Since we use AI to sell work, we make money through transaction fees - usually 2-3% of purchase price. \r\n\r\nWeâ€™re excited to bring much needed innovation to an otherwise extremely archaic world of small business M&A ðŸ™‚\r\n",
