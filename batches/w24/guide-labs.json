  "long_description": "At Guide labs, we build interpretable foundation models that can reliably explain their reasoning, and are easy to align. We provide access to these models via an API. Over the past 6 years, our team has built and deployed interpretable models at Meta, and Google. \r\n\r\nOur models provide explanations that:  \r\n1) provide human-understandable explanations, for each output token, \r\n2) which parts of the input (prompt) is most important for each part of the generated output, and 3) which inputs, in the training data, directly led to the model's generated output. \r\n\r\nBecause our models can explain their outputs, they are easier to debug, steer, and align.
