  "long_description": "Aidy uses AI to track and understand what Congress and state legislatures are doing. Following relevant legislation across jurisdictions is difficult and time consuming, but new laws and regulations can have dramatic impacts on entire industries. With Aidy, government affairs professionals can find the bills that matter to them, generate custom reports in seconds, and always find the right people in government to talk to about a bill or issue.\r\n\r\nIn our previous policy-centric roles at The Rockefeller Foundation, U.S. Senate, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, we saw how difficult it is to stay on top of public policy changes. We quickly realized the enormous potential of AI in making policy intelligence more accessible. From there, Aidy was born!",
