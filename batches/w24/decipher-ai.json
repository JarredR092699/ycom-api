  "long_description": "Decipher AI is a next-gen Sentry replacement that helps you uncover, prioritize, and debug production issues faster.\r\n\r\nIt lets engineers identify and resolve production issues by analyzing runtime data and product behavior with AI. Companies use us to monitor their application and to quickly understand what went wrong, the user impact, and how to fix it.\r\n\r\nAI Product Analysis\r\nDecipher determined the real product impact using session replays, code, and error data so you can prioritize and map them to support tickets.\r\n\r\nIntelligent Alerting\r\nDecipher's AI distinguishes critical issues from noise, ensuring you only receive alerts that demand your attention. No fussy filters or thresholds required.\r\n\r\nSmart Grouping\r\nDecipher automatically clusters related errors, giving you a clear overview of issues affecting your product. The first actually useful error dashboard. \r\n\r\nIssue Insights\r\nDecipher reveals patterns and insights across every instance of the same error by analyzing all shared attributes - including requests, logs, and local variables.\r\n\r\nAI Debugging\r\nDecipher's AI uses codebase wide understanding and product context to root cause bugs. It can help you get started or even submit a pull request.\r\n\r\nCustomer Reports, Correlated\r\nDecipher automatically correlates support tickets with relevant errors, bridging the gap between customer reports and monitoring.\r\n\r\nContact us at founders@getdecipher.com or book a demo here: https://cal.com/decipher/demo",
