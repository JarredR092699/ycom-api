  "long_description": "We help investment bankers & consultants prepare materials faster & with fewer errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarousel is a PowerPoint plugin carrying a suite of tools designed to help junior professionals save time while putting together decks. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur first tool brought a supercharged version of Word's \"Track Changes\" to PowerPoint so deal teams could quickly review each other's work, speeding up the feedback loop of giving and turning comments by 10x.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur second tool uses computer vision to populate charts and tables in PowerPoint based on Excel data, as well as extract table data from PDFs into Excel with two clicks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe've got many more features on the way that build out a complete toolbelt, including an AI copilot for PowerPoint that can handle complex, multi-step tasks, outperforming Microsoft's native copilot.",
