  "long_description": "Abalone Bio developed a technology to find antibody drugs that activate and modulate cell surface receptors, the “antennae” on cells that help convert chemical signals into cellular responses, like growth. Antibodies are a growing class of drugs that have tremendous safety and efficacy advantages over small molecules; 7 of the top 10 selling drugs are antibodies, earning an average of $7B in revenue. However, antibodies- especially ones that activate and modulate cell surface receptors- are hard to find. Abalone Bio expands the playing field for antibody therapeutics and enables us to previously access treatments for untreated diseases.\r\n\r\nWe have already discovered a novel antibody that activates a non-opioid receptor that produces analgesia. We are developing this antibody into a treatment for neuropathic pain – a medical condition that currently is treated with drugs like addictive opiates. The same molecule is also a potential treatment for inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, all 1B+ markets.\r\n",
