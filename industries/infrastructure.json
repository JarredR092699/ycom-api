Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability.\r\n\r\nBy working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images and videos will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it.\r\n\r\nimgix was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program.

So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.\r\n\r\nBig companies like Amazon, Facebook etc built sophisticated incident response tools to achieve high availability and resiliency.

It ingests, processes, and routes log data to fuel enterprise-level application development and delivery, security, and compliance use cases.\r\n\r\nMezmo was brought to life by three-time co-founders Chris Nguyen and Lee Liu and included in the Winter 2015 batch of Y Combinator. In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\nMezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t.\r\n\r\nWe’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes.\r\nWe have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments.\r\nWe are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too.\r\nWe have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better.\r\nMezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.\r\n\r\nWe have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.\r\n",

As video streaming continues to become more mainstream and the streams themselves become HD and 4K, traditional CDNs struggle to deliver high quality viewing experiences. Many publishers try to keep up with peak demand by paying for more servers, many of which are almost never used and struggle with video playback. Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. \r\n\r\nOur CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.\r\n\r\nOur video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers.",

This leads to a ton of complexity around the ways models are run, the kinds of extra processing needed to happen around them, and the complexity of pipelines that solve the most valuable use cases in the modality. To this end, Sieve’s strongest and most immediate value proposition comes from being an AI toolkit that solves problems unique to video — unlike generic AI developer tools that might exist today.\r\n\r\nVideo is just the start however.

With Markprompt, companies can automate customer support, scale without increasing headcount, and deliver exceptional user experiences.\r\n \r\nScaling customer support with headcount is expensive, with human resources accounting for 90%+ of customer support expenses. On top of that, customer support agents often burn out leading to turnover and reduced quality. As companies grow, so does their expert knowledge, which is hard to access at scale and makes keeping employees up-to-date nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nMarkprompt addresses the root of the information access problem by indexing all available knowledge within a company, setting the foundation for a robust system of record to feed the AI. Built from the ground up with an API-first approach, Markprompt provides SDKs (such as React hooks and components) and no-code tools to enable integrations at all touchpoints in the customer journey.",

Since spot instances can get pre-empted at any point, running CI reliably on them requires [significant engineering investment](https://www.rippling.com/blog/how-rippling-used-spot-instances-to-save-and-scale-ci-cd).\r\n\r\nBlacksmith offers CI compute that is more performant, cheaper, and reliable. With Blacksmith, companies do not have to think about CI as they scale.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with GitHub Actions - today's most popular and fastest-growing CI system. With a one-line change, companies can run their CI up to twice as fast on our high-performance hardware. In addition to this, Blacksmith provides colocated warm caches along with optimizations for common CI workloads (like building and pushing Docker images).\r\n\r\nAayush, JP and Aditya have gained deep systems and product knowledge from their time at Cockroach Labs and Faire respectively. Both these companies, with several hundred engineers, were spending in the order of millions of dollars on their CI. Yet they were riddled with slow CI and actively seeking out cheaper and faster alternatives.

That's when we saw the massive drawbacks of closed-source LLMs in production, making us start Pipeshift. We met 6 years back as roommates during undergrad, and before starting Pipeshift, we led a defense robotics non-profit backed by NVIDIA and built a health-tech startup.\r\n\r\nThe shift to AI is like the shift to the cloud, every company is going to implement AI. And, open-source AI will be as good as closed-source AI. Meta's Llama 3.1 models prove that. But, the open-source AI stack is a complete mess, with companies needing a team of engineers to set up 10+ different tools just to get started and every optimization needs countless engineering hours.\r\n\r\nPipeshift offers this stack out of the box. With our fine-tuning + distilling platform and one-click deployment stack for hosting these LLMs, we ensure 10x faster experimentation cycles and time-to-production.
