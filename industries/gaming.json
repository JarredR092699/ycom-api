    "long_description": "We're creating digital toys and tools that empower kids to create, learn & share their ideas through play.\r\n\r\nGive a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).\r\n\r\nAt Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.",

The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.\n\nSoon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.\n\nAnd the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.\n\nFitfu allows you to:\n\n* Track your motion\n\nUsing the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.\n\n* Celebrate progress with friends\n\nFriends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.\n\n* Discover a new way to stay motivated\n\nThe more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.\n\n* Stay active wherever, whenever\n\nNo more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)\n\n*Lose what you want\n\nParticipate with Fitfu at your level of interest - decide to be gung ho, middle of the road, or simply casual.",

The next stage is to advance the engine to power generated 3D environments / mechanics and allow any user to create their own open world RPGs.\r\n\r\nWe are three friends who met in undergrad at Princeton. Derrick published multiple papers on LLMs while at Google Research, all of which were accepted to NeurIPS. Jason worked as a full stack engineer at both Google and Duolingo.
