They've included several bundles of code libraries for databases and more importantly interfacing with the Facebook API. In order to efficiently host users' applications, AppJet has developed their own application virtualization system. The system allocates processor time to active applications and cuts off greedy ones after running an alloted number of compiled lines of code to prevent abuse.\n\nAppJet as a dev platform seems no longer to be active.

In ten years, we want the majority of apps worldwide to have been built with Glide.\r\n\r\nWe're four technical founders with expertise in native mobile frameworks, developer tools, and product design.

We do this by optimally delivering nudges based on in-product behavior not just static rules as well as measuring measuring and the extent to which users “rage close” nudges to avoid pestering them. A replacement for legacy Digital Adoption Platforms\r\n\r\nUser assistance translates into concrete outcomes like improved engagement, feature adoption, conversion, and retention, all while decreasing low-value support tickets.\r\n\r\nWe’re used by teams like HubSpot, HashiCorp, Yotpo, Thryvv, and Freshworks.",

    "long_description": "Hypermile is on a mission to improve trucking efficiency, sustainability and safety by developing an AI driver assistance system 🚛 🌎🌱.\r\n\r\nToday, fuel is the main cost component for logistics operators, accounting for >1/3 of all operating costs. Driving behavior is a key factor affecting overall fuel consumption and can increase fuel use by up to 35%. However, current solutions are not cost effective, so logistics operators are constantly looking for new solutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition, logistics operators are under huge sustainability pressure, as Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are responsible for 16% of the UK's transport emissions but only 5% of the miles travelled. While electric vehicle sales for passenger vehicles are on the rise, the same can't be said for long-haul HGVs due to high initial cost and limited range, making it impractical for logistic purposes. \r\n\r\nWith this problem in mind, we aim to leverage the latest AI techniques to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel trucks today, and increase the range of zero-emission trucks of the future. \r\n\r\nOur product Hypermile Co-Pilot is a retrofittable AI cruise control for commercial vehicles focused on controlling the speed of the truck efficiently. We have trained the AI algorithms to learn the best techniques for saving fuel: anticipating how traffic flow will change, optimising speed based on the road gradient and maximizing vehicle coasting. As a result, we can reduce diesel consumption by 11% and extend the range of battery-electric vehicles by 15%. The long term vision is to incrementally build higher levels of autonomy with the next milestone being a Level-3 autonomous trucking solution. \r\n\r\nThe company was founded in May 2020 and raised a $1.5M pre-seed round in May 2021 from Y Combinator, Greg Brockman (CTO of OpenAI), Luc Vincent (former Executive VP of Autonomous Driving at Lyft Level 5) and others. We’ve received a number of R&D grants from Innovate UK, Department for Transport and Horizons 2020. We’re currently a team of 10 across Commercial, Product and Engineering (including 4. sub-teams cloud software, machine learning, automotive software and electronics).\r\n",

Not only are the APIs and documentations less available, but they are also old school and ridden with errors and loopholes. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, the lack of a single point of contact from the underlying institutions, makes the already long integration cycle of 5 months feel like a temple run between different departments. And since those services break and update over time, you can imagine the nightmare in terms of coordination between the tech teams. \r\n\r\nWe are a full-stack platform where you can come, select your desired modules, play in the sandbox, and launch your product with the APIs and SDKs within a couple of weeks! Not only that, but we also take care of all upcoming fixes, iterations, and updates without breaking any flow.\r\n\r\nIt's that easy, as it should be. Welcome to the future.",

By implementing Vue Storefront, you will improve your overall User Experience and lift up your revenues by at least 20%. \r\n\r\n1. Lightning Fast\r\nWe are on a mission to improve loading times for eCommerce users, especially on mobile devices. We want to make sure, that every site using Vue Storefront will load in under 2 seconds for all users across the globe. Currently, it is their weak spot:  \r\na) It takes, on average, 15.3 seconds to fully load a mobile page. \r\nb) 75% of mobile sites take longer than 10 seconds to load.  \r\nc) 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. \r\n\r\nLoading times mean better User Experience and this leads to eCommerce users buying more, giving better conversion rates:  \r\na) Walmart found that for every 1-second improvement in page load time, conversions increased by 2%  \r\nb) Increase of conversion % at each stage of the Customer Buying Journey at eCommerce based on 0.1s improvement based on Google Research (https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/future-of marketing/creativity/mobile-page-speed-data/) \r\n\r\n2. Fast Time To Value\r\nVue Storefront is the glue for headless commerce,  giving merchants the ability to connect with any eCommerce backend, any CMS, or any other 3rd party service, as we provide those APIs by default in our cloud platform.  This is saving our clients thousands of development hours. \r\n\r\nAlso, because of the Progressive Web App features that we provide, there is no need to build native iOS or Android apps - everything is available through the web. In combination with frontend components provided out of the box, it is possible to build a new eCommerce frontend within weeks, not months. \r\n\r\n3. Fast content adjustments  with any Headless CMS\r\nHeadless CMS is the only way to embrace omnichannel sales, and we know it. That is why the Enterprise version of Vue Storefront delivers the API-first setup of integrations with the best Headless CMSes out-of-the-box. \r\n\r\nIt allows business users to edit the content & publish with a no-code approach\r\n\r\n4. Fast learning curve for developers  \r\nWe use the modern tech stack that is easily adaptable by the developer community, and what is better market proof than the popularity of our Open Source Project? We are currently the 5th most popular eCommerce framework globally and the 1st Frontend eCommerce Framework globally!\r\nhttps://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/\r\nhttps://www.vuestorefront.io/",

Companies use Koala so that they don't have to hire dedicated infrastructure engineers.\r\n\r\nAlthough 50-70% of organizations have already adopted Kubernetes, most developers agree that it is too complex and difficult to manage. It is intended to be extremely flexible in order to solve pretty much everyone’s needs, but it can take a ton of work and many auxiliary tools to get there.\r\n\r\nAs companies grow, they spend a lot on DevOps or Platform Engineers that try to reduce the burden on developers by gluing together all the 3p tools via custom internal tools.\r\n\r\nWe are building an “internal developer platform” out of the box, with best practices and golden paths for building and operating services on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nWe do the research on the latest and greatest tools in the extremely vibrant ecosystem, and automatically integrate for you the tools you want to use.\r\n\r\nWe operate on our customers code and in your Cloud environment, so they never locked in and never restricted, as is common with classic PaaS offerings.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a fully hosted environment like Heroku, Fly or Vercel, we’ll host a cluster for you and offer you a one-click migration to your own cluster when you want.",

Partnering with Tahsin, a neighbour with a PhD in AI, and Mohammed, a seasoned engineering VP with experience in construction software, they turned the dream into reality.\r\n\r\nSince their launch in August, DraftAid has engaged customers through targeted outreach and word-of-mouth, securing paid pilots with subsequent contracts valued at $150,000.\r\n\r\nBe a part of ushering in the new era of CAD designs!",

Storia is building an open-source copilot that knows a company's codebase and its context.\r\n\r\nWe are starting with Sage, a Perplexity-like agent for helping developers understand, judge, and generate software. Given an existing codebase, developers can ask Sage questions such as:\r\n1) Given my project’s SLA and latency constraints, what is the appropriate underlying vector database to use? How would I incorporate it into my existing codebase?\r\n2) Why should I pick Redis over Milvus as my underlying vector store?\r\n3) Does this codebase in our organization still work and what steps are required for a complex integration with another library?\r\n\r\nSage’s answers are directly supported by documentation and external references like GitHub, Stack Overflow, technical design documents, and project management software, preventing hallucinations. Today, Sage has up-to-date knowledge about open-source repositories (indexed daily). Tomorrow it will have a deep understanding of every line of code on the Internet. For teams, Sage will know about your private codebase too.\r\n\r\nNo group has yet solved how to build an AI system that comprehends a codebase and its context and can empower every developer to architect better code, faster. This requires new research advances because vanilla RAG and out-of-the-box LLMs aren’t going to cut it. \r\n\r\nWe have 20+ years of software engineering and AI research experience. Julia worked on precursors of Gemini using contextual neural techniques before they were called “RAG” (and applied it to products like Google Keyboard and Pixel phones). Mihail built the earliest LLMs at Amazon Alexa and launched the first contextual deep learning conversational AI system in production at Alexa.\r\n",

However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Approach: \r\nIn our research, we have developed algorithms for chemical process optimization, which leverage transfer learning and Bayesian optimization. We validated the algorithms in the wet lab, showing an up to 95% reduction in required experiments and cost compared to exhaustive screening. We have made our approaches accessible to chemists through our user-friendly no-code software platform and to automated laboratory equipment with our API.",

Even with a dedicated ML team, it took too much time to build simple AI features. It was clear that if large companies were struggling with this, SMBs would definitely be left behind. We went directly to our network of SMB operators and found our hunch was correct. Within a week we had two paying customers even before launching our first prototype.\r\n\r\nVoker is built for product specialists who know they can delight their users with AI but can't spend engineering bandwidth on building those features.
