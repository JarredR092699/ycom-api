But the vendor community has responded with hard-to-use, hard-to-implement, and hard-to-purchase private sector software rather than building something from the ground up. These outdated solutions fail to address government workers’ unique challenges. \n\nSeneca Systems was founded to address those challenges and strengthen the vital bond between government and people. Our Constituent Services Platform, Romulus, centralizes constituent communications, organizes service requests, and provides insights into constituent preferences and work performed. Built for governments by people who love government workers, Romulus enables government workers to get more done in less time, with less overhead, and to more constituent applause.",

We’ve worked with over 500 clients nationwide, and volunteers have sent over 100 million text messages on behalf of Planned Parenthood, the DCCC, SEIU, Community Change, When We All Vote, Greenpeace, and campaigns up and down the ballot. Our work has been featured in The New York Times, Washington Post, TechCrunch, Fast Company, and many more.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, Impactive will expand its platform further into nonprofit, advocacy, and additional markets.

Their technology is outdated, their source code proprietary and their security vulnerabilities – described in detail by the security community over many years – are left unpatched. It’s not surprising that 76% of voters are concerned that our elections are vulnerable to hacking. And if voters lose trust in elections, then the very foundation of our democracy is at risk.\r\n\r\nWe’re using open-source software, off-the-shelf hardware, and modern product engineering to make elections dramatically safer, more accessible, and more affordable.
